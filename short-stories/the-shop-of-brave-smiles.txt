🏪 The Shop of Brave Smiles!

In a European town stood a shop where smiles were given bravely. Clara smiled even when nervous. Emil smiled while helping. Helena smiled when speaking the truth.

The teacher explained, “Brave smiles are treasures greater than gold.”

Soon, villagers visited the shop daily. From that day, the Shop of Brave Smiles reminded everyone that courage can be shown in a smile._The End
