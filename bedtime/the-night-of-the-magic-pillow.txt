The Night of the Magic Pillow!

In Italy, Lucia had a pillow sewn with silver thread. At night the pillow shimmered and lifted her into the sky. She floated across valleys, meeting children who shared songs of joy. The pillow carried her to a meadow where stars grew like flowers, each one blooming with gentle light. Lucia touched them, and they whispered dreams of courage. When morning came, she woke with a smile, knowing her pillow held magic that would always guard her sleep.
