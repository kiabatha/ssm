🖐️ The Classroom of Caring Hands!

In a European school, children gathered in a bright classroom. Madame Clara asked them to use their hands for kindness. Lukas helped carry books. Helena shared her crayons. Emil cleaned the chalkboard.

Clara said, “Caring hands make learning joyful.” Soon, the classroom became a place of gentle actions.

From that day, the Classroom of Caring Hands reminded everyone that kindness can be shown through simple deeds.__The End
