🐐 The Goat’s Gentle Smile!

In the hills of Spain lived a goat named Rosa. Rosa was gentle and calm. She loved standing on the hillside, watching the sunrise. Her smile was soft and kind, and it made everyone feel peaceful.

One day, the villagers faced a problem. The children were worried about their exams, and the farmers were tired from work. Everyone felt stressed. Rosa walked through the village, smiling at each person. The baker laughed, the teacher relaxed, and the children felt calmer.

A girl named Maria asked, “Rosa, how do you make everyone feel better?” Rosa replied, “A gentle smile is a gift. It costs nothing, but it brings peace.”
The villagers realized that Rosa’s smile was more powerful than words. They began to smile at each other. Soon, the village felt lighter and happier. Rosa taught them that kindness can be as simple as a smile.

From that day, Rosa’s gentle smile became a symbol of peace. Whenever someone felt worried, they remembered her gift and shared a smile.---The End
