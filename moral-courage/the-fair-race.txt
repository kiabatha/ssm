The Fair Race!

Leo loved running. During the school race, he sprinted ahead, but then he saw another runner trip and fall. His friends shouted, “Keep going! You’ll win!”
Leo slowed down, turned back, and helped the boy to his feet. Together, they crossed the finish line last.

The crowd clapped, and the teacher said, “That was the greatest victory today.”
Leo realized moral courage meant helping others, even if it costs you the prize.
