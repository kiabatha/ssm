🌉 The Bridge of Gentle Stars!

In a European town stood a bridge decorated with stars. Clara said, “Each star is gentleness.” Emil added, “They glow when we care.”

The teacher explained, “Gentle stars guide us like lanterns.”

Soon, villagers joined. The bridge became a place of peace. From that day, the Bridge of Gentle Stars reminded everyone that gentleness shines like starlight._The End
