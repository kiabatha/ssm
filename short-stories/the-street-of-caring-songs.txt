🎶 The Street of Caring Songs!

Children walked along a street where songs were sung with care. Helena sang softly, Emil played the flute, Clara clapped.

The teacher explained, “Caring songs are stronger than walls.”

Soon, villagers joined. The street echoed with kindness.

From that day, the Street of Caring Songs reminded everyone that care can be heard in music._The End
