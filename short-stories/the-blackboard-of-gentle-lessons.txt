🖤 The Blackboard of Gentle Lessons!

In a European classroom, the teacher wrote gentle lessons on the blackboard: “Be kind,” “Help others,” “Speak truth.”

Children copied the words into notebooks. Clara said, “Gentle lessons make strong hearts.”

From that day, the Blackboard of Gentle Lessons reminded everyone that kindness can be taught.__The End
