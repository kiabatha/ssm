The Dreamy Castle!

In Austria, Helena dreamed of a castle that appeared only at night. Its towers glowed with silver light, and its gates opened to children who carried hope in their hearts. Helena walked through halls filled with laughter, where portraits told stories and staircases led to gardens of stars. She met friends from every land, and together they built bridges of kindness across the castle walls. When dawn arrived, the castle faded, but Helena woke with courage, knowing that dreams can build castles stronger than stone.
