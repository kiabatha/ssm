The Teamwork Treasure!

In the playground, the children found a small box buried under the sand. It was locked with a puzzle. The teacher said, “You can open it only if you work together.”

The children gathered around. One child read the clues, another searched for numbers, and another tried to fit the pieces. At first, they argued, but then they remembered that teamwork means listening and helping.

Slowly, the puzzle began to make sense. Finally, they opened the box. Inside were shiny stones with words written on them: “Kindness,” “Sharing,” “Honesty,” and “Friendship.”

The teacher said, “This is the real treasure. These words are more valuable than gold.”

The children cheered. They learned that teamwork brings not only success but also joy.
