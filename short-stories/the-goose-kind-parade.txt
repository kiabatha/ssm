🦢 The Goose’s Kind Parade!

In the village, a goose named Clara led a parade. She invited small animals to join. Emil the rabbit carried flowers. Helena the fox waved her tail.

The goose said, “Kindness makes parades brighter.”
The teacher owl explained, “A kind parade is the happiest celebration.”

From that day, Clara’s parade reminded everyone that kindness is the best march._The End
