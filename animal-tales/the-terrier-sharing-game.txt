🐕 The Terrier’s Sharing Game!

In a European town lived a terrier named Max. Max loved playing fetch with the children. He always carried a ball in his mouth, but instead of keeping it, he shared it with everyone.

One afternoon, the children argued over toys. Max ran to them, dropped his ball, and wagged his tail. He barked happily, inviting them to play together. Soon, laughter filled the square. The teacher said, “Max’s game teaches us sharing.”

Max realized that joy grows when shared. From that day, his game became a symbol of friendship.---The End
