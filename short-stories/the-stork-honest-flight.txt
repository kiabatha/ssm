🦩 The Stork’s Honest Flight!

A stork named Emil flew across valleys carrying letters. He never hid or changed the words. Clara asked, “Will my letter reach safely?” Emil replied, “Yes, because honesty carries wings.”

The villagers trusted him. His flight was long, but his honesty made it strong.

The teacher owl explained, “An honest flight is the safest journey.”

From that day, Emil’s flight reminded everyone that truth travels farther than wind._The End
