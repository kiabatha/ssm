🐕‍🦺 The Shepherd Dog’s Loyal Promise!

In a European mountain village lived a shepherd dog named Markus. Markus guarded the sheep faithfully. He promised himself never to leave them alone.

One winter, a storm came. The sheep scattered in fear. Markus ran through the snow, guiding them back. He barked loudly, circling them until they were safe in the barn. The children clapped. “Markus kept his promise!”

The farmer said, “Loyalty is stronger than fear.” Markus realized that his promise was not only to the sheep, but to the village. From that day, he became known as the shepherd dog with the loyal promise, teaching everyone that true loyalty protects and comforts.---The End
