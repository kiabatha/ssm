🕊️ The Letter of Kind Words!

Helena loved writing letters. One afternoon in her European school, she wrote a note to Clara: “You are brave. You make me smile.” Clara read it and felt joy.

Soon, Emil received a letter too: “You are kind. You help others.” He laughed and said, “Words can be gifts.” The teacher explained, “Kind words are stronger than paper. They live in hearts.”

The children decided to write letters for everyone in the class. Some wrote about friendship, others about courage. The classroom filled with laughter and gentle voices.

Later, the villagers joined. They wrote letters to neighbors, thanking them for help and care. The postman carried bundles of kindness across the town.

From that day, the Letter of Kind Words reminded everyone that writing can spread joy like sunlight._The End
