🕯️ The Hedgehog’s Honest Lantern!

A hedgehog named Helena carried a lantern. She never hid its light. She showed the path honestly. Clara the rabbit said, “Your lantern makes us trust you.” Emil the fox added, “It shines with truth.”

The teacher owl explained, “An honest lantern glows brighter than gold.”

From that day, Helena’s lantern reminded everyone that honesty lights the way._The End
