🏰 The Tower of Kind Wishes!

In a European town stood a tall stone tower. Villagers said it carried kind wishes to the sky. Children often climbed the steps to look out over the rooftops.

One afternoon, Helena brought a basket of paper. She asked her friends to write wishes for others. Emil wrote, “I wish my grandmother health.” Clara wrote, “I wish my friend courage.”

They tied the papers to ribbons and placed them at the top of the tower. The wind carried them gently away. The children smiled. “The tower shares our kindness.”

The mayor said, “Wishes for others make hearts strong.” Soon, the villagers joined. They filled the tower with ribbons of hope.

From that day, the Tower of Kind Wishes became a place where children learned that kindness grows when shared.---The End
