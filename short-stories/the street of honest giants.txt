🚶 The Street of Honest Giants!

In a European town stood statues of giants. Clara said, “They are strong, but honest.” Emil nodded, “Honesty is true courage.”

The teacher explained, “Honest giants remind us that strength can be kind.”

Soon, villagers visited to learn from the statues. From that day, the Street of Honest Giants reminded everyone that honesty is the greatest strength._The End
