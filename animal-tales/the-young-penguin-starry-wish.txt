🐧 The Young Penguin’s Starry Wish!

In a snowy European village lived a young penguin named Clara. Clara loved the night sky. She wished to touch a star. Her friends said, “Penguins belong on ice, not in the sky.” But Clara whispered, “Dreams can fly.”

One evening, children built lanterns shaped like stars. They placed them on the ice. Clara slid across, touching each lantern with joy. The children clapped. “Clara touched the stars!”

Clara realized that wishes may not happen exactly as imagined, but they can shine in new ways. From that day, she carried her starry wish in her heart, teaching others to dream bravely.---The End
