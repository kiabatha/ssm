The Friend Who Waited!

Amir loved running races. One day, he ran so fast that he reached the finish line before everyone else. He cheered, but then he noticed his friend Ali was far behind. Ali had tripped and was walking slowly.

Amir thought about leaving, but then he remembered that friendship means waiting. He walked back and stood beside Ali. Together, they crossed the finish line.

The other children clapped. Ali smiled and said, “Thank you for waiting. You are a true friend.”

Amir learned that winning is not always about being first. Sometimes, the greatest victory is crossing the line together.
