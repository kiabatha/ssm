🐟 The Fish Who Loved The Sky!

In a clear European lake lived a curious fish named Lucia. Lucia loved swimming, but she often looked up at the sky and wondered, “What is it like to fly?” She watched birds soaring above and dreamed of joining them.

Her friends laughed kindly. “Fish belong in water,” said her cousin Paolo. But Lucia did not give up. She leapt from the water again and again, trying to reach the sky. Each time she fell back, but her heart grew stronger.

One day, a boy named Adrian saw her jumping. He said, “Lucia, you cannot fly like a bird, but you can leap higher than any fish. That is your gift.” Adrian built a small wooden ramp by the lake. Lucia swam fast and leapt from the ramp, soaring higher than ever before. The children clapped and shouted, “Look, the fish touches the sky!”

Lucia realized that dreams may not happen exactly as imagined, but they can still come true in new ways. She did not become a bird, but she became the fish who touched the sky. Her courage inspired the village. Children learned that hope is not about being perfect. It is about trying with joy.---The End
