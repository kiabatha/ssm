The Bridge of Kindness!

In the village, a small wooden bridge crossed a stream. Children often hurried across without noticing it. One day, Bilal saw an old man struggling to carry a heavy bag across the bridge. Bilal rushed to help him. The man smiled and said, “You built a bridge of kindness today.”

Bilal thought about those words. The next day, he helped a younger child cross safely. Soon, other children began to help too. They carried books, held hands, and even sang songs while crossing.

The bridge became more than wood and nails. It became a place of friendship. The children learned that kindness is like a bridge. It connects hearts and makes journeys easier.
