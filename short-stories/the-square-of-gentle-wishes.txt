🏛️ The Square of Gentle Wishes!

In a European town square, children made gentle wishes. Clara wished for peace. Emil wished for kindness. Helena wished for courage.

The teacher explained, “Gentle wishes guide us like stars.”

Soon, villagers joined. The square became filled with hope. From that day, the Square of Gentle Wishes reminded everyone that kindness begins with gentle dreams._The End
