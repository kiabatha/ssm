A Smile for Everyone!

Maya walked through the park with a big smile. She smiled at the old man on the bench, at the little girl with her puppy, and at the gardener watering flowers. Each person smiled back. Maya felt her heart grow warm. She learned that a smile is a gift that costs nothing but gives joy to everyone.
