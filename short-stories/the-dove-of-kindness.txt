🕊️ The Dove of Kindness!

One spring, Helena found a dove in the schoolyard. Its wing was hurt. Lukas helped her care for it. Emil brought food.

The dove healed and flew again. Clara said, “Kindness gives wings.”
From that day, the Dove of Kindness reminded children that gentle care brings freedom._The End
