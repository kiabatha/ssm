🔔 The School Bell of Courage!

Each morning, the bell rang in a European school. Children entered bravely, even when lessons felt hard. Lukas said, “The bell teaches us courage.”

Soon, children began helping each other whenever the bell rang. They faced challenges together.

The teacher explained, “Courage grows when we begin with hope.”

From that day, the School Bell of Courage reminded everyone that bravery can start each morning.__The End
