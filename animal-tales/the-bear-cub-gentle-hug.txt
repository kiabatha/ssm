🐻 The Bear Cub’s Gentle Hug!

In a European forest lived a bear cub named Leon. Leon was playful and curious, but his favorite thing was giving hugs. Whenever he met friends, he wrapped his small paws around them gently.

One autumn, the forest grew cold. The animals felt lonely. Leon walked to each of them and gave a gentle hug. The rabbit smiled, the fox relaxed, and the owl whispered, “His hug warms the heart.”

One day, children visited the forest. Leon waddled to them and hugged softly. They laughed and clapped. “Leon’s hug is gentle and kind.” The elder bear said, “Strength is not only in claws. It is in care.”

Leon realized that his gift was not size or power, but gentleness. From that day, he hugged proudly, teaching everyone that kindness can be shown in the simplest touch.---The End
