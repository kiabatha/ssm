👑 The Unicorn of Caring Stars!

Children decorated a crown with stars. Each star carried a caring word: “Hope,” “Trust,” “Kindness.” The unicorn touched the crown with its horn, making the stars glow.

The teacher explained, “Caring stars shine when shared.”

Soon, children created their own crowns with paper stars. 

Villagers joined, adding stars of forgiveness and joy. The unicorn’s horn glowed brighter with each star.

From that day, the Unicorn of Caring Stars reminded everyone that care makes us shine, and that crowns are not for ruling but for sharing kindness._The End
