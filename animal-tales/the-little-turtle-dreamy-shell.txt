🐢 The Little Turtle’s Dreamy Shell!

In a European pond lived a turtle named Adrian. Adrian had a small shell, but he dreamed of painting it with stars. Other turtles laughed kindly. “Shells are plain,” they said. Adrian whispered, “Dreams make shells special.”

He collected flowers, leaves, and shiny stones. He decorated his shell with care. Children saw him and clapped. “Adrian’s shell is dreamy!”

The teacher said, “Dreams make ordinary things beautiful.” Adrian realized that his shell was not small. It was a canvas for hope. From that day, he carried his dreamy shell proudly, teaching others to see beauty in their own gifts.---The End
