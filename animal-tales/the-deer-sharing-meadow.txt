🦌 The Deer’s Sharing Meadow!

In a European valley lived a deer named Helena. Helena loved the meadow where flowers bloomed and grass grew tall. She often grazed alone, but she dreamed of sharing the meadow with others.

One summer, animals struggled to find food. Helena opened her meadow to them. Rabbits hopped in, birds sang, and hedgehogs played. The children of the village saw this and clapped. “Helena’s meadow is for everyone!”

The mayor said, “Sharing makes the meadow brighter.” Helena realized that kindness grows when shared. From that day, her meadow became a place of friendship.---The End
