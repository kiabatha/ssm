The Kindness Parade!

One morning, the teacher announced, “Today we will have a kindness parade.” The children were curious. She explained, “Each of you will carry a sign that shows a kind act you have done.”

The children began to prepare. Sara wrote, “I shared my lunch.” Amir wrote, “I helped my grandmother.” Fatima wrote, “I told the truth.” Soon, the classroom was full of colorful signs.

When the parade began, the children marched through the schoolyard. They waved their signs proudly. Other students clapped and cheered. Even the principal came out to watch.

One boy said, “This parade is better than any celebration. It shows how kindness makes us strong.” The teacher smiled and added, “Kindness is not just for today. It is for every day.”

The children promised to keep their kindness alive. They learned that when kindness is shared, it becomes a celebration that everyone can join.
