🌲 The Treehouse of Brave Hearts!

In a European forest, children built a wooden treehouse high in the branches. They called it the Treehouse of Brave Hearts.

One afternoon, Lukas and Clara climbed up with their friends. The ladder was tall, and some children felt afraid. Lukas said, “Bravery is not about being fearless. It is about trying.”

Step by step, each child climbed. When they reached the top, they saw the forest spread wide below. Birds flew past, and the wind carried their laughter. Clara said, “Our hearts are brave because we helped each other.”

The teacher later visited. She explained, “Bravery grows when we share courage.” The children realized that the treehouse was more than wood and nails. It was a place where hearts grew strong.

From that day, the Treehouse of Brave Hearts became a symbol of courage and friendship.---The End
