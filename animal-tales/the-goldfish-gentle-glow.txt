🐟 The Goldfish’s Gentle Glow!

In a European village lived a goldfish named Marco. Marco swam in a glass bowl at the school. His scales glowed softly in the sunlight. The children loved watching him.

One day, a boy named Stefan felt sad. He sat by Marco’s bowl. Marco swam gently, circling with his glowing scales. Stefan smiled. “Your glow makes me feel better.” Soon, more children came whenever they felt worried. Marco’s gentle glow calmed them.

The teacher said, “Marco teaches us that even small lights can bring peace.” Marco realized that his gift was not size, but comfort. From that day, his gentle glow became a symbol of hope for the school.---The End
