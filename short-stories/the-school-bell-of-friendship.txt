🔔 The School Bell of Friendship!

Each morning, the bell rang in a European school. Children greeted each other with smiles. Clara said, “The bell begins friendship.”

Soon, children began helping each other whenever the bell rang.

The teacher explained, “Friendship is the best way to start learning.”

From that day, the School Bell of Friendship reminded everyone that friendship is the first lesson.__The End
