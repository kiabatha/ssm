The Kindness Kite!

On a windy day, Bilal brought his new kite to the park. It was red and yellow, with a long tail that danced in the air. He wanted to fly it alone, but his little sister asked if she could hold the string. Bilal hesitated, then remembered what his teacher had said: “Kindness makes joy grow.”

He gave her the string, and her face lit up with happiness. Soon, other children gathered. Bilal let each of them take turns. The kite soared higher and higher, as if it was proud of being shared.

One boy said, “This kite is like kindness. When you share it, it flies better.” Bilal smiled. He realized that his kite was not just a toy. It was a way to bring friends together.

At the end of the day, the children sat on the grass, watching the sunset. Bilal felt glad that he had shared. His sister hugged him and whispered, “Thank you.” Bilal learned that kindness is like a kite. The more you give, the higher it flies.
