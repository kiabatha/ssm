🐻 The Cub’s Courageous Roar!

In a European forest lived a bear cub named Hugo. Hugo was small and shy. His roar was quiet. Other animals teased him. “You cannot roar like a bear.” Hugo whispered, “One day, I will be brave.”

One evening, a storm came. Trees shook, and the animals felt afraid. Hugo climbed a rock and tried to roar. At first, it was soft. Then he roared again, louder. His voice echoed through the forest. The animals gathered, feeling safe.

The owl said, “Hugo’s roar is courageous.” The children who lived nearby clapped. “He is brave!” Hugo realized that courage is not about size. It is about using your voice when it matters.

From that day, Hugo roared proudly, teaching others that bravery grows when we face fear.---The End
