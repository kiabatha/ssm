The Moonstone Garden!

Clara found the moonstone while digging in her backyard. It was smooth and white and glowed faintly in her hand. She put it in her pocket and forgot about it.

That night, she woke to strange music. She looked out her window and saw her backyard transformed. Flowers made of light grew where regular flowers used to be. Trees sparkled with silver leaves. Everything glowed with soft moonlight.

Clara ran outside. The grass felt cool under her bare feet. As she walked through the garden, the flowers chimed like bells. The trees hummed gentle melodies.

At the center of the garden stood a fountain that was not there before. Water flowed upward instead of down, forming shapes in the air: butterflies, birds, and dragons made of liquid silver.

A woman appeared beside the fountain. She wore a dress that looked like starlight and a crown of moonflowers. "Hello, Clara," she said. "I am Luna, guardian of the Moon Gardens."

"What is this place?" Clara asked.

"You found a moonstone," Luna explained. "It opens a door between your world and mine. Moon Gardens grow wherever moonstones touch the earth. They only appear at night."

"Why?" Clara asked.

"Because magic needs mystery," Luna said. "If people saw magic all the time, they would stop appreciating it. The night keeps magic special."

Luna showed Clara around the garden. She explained that every flower had a purpose. Some brought good dreams. Others healed sadness. Some helped people remember things they had forgotten.

"Can I pick one?" Clara asked.

"You may pick one flower each visit," Luna said. "But choose wisely. Each flower works only once."

Clara chose a flower called Evening Hope. Luna said it would help someone who was feeling lost.

The next morning, the garden looked normal again. Clara still had the glowing flower in her hand. She took it to school and gave it to her friend Marcus, who had been sad since his grandfather died.

When Marcus held the flower, it dissolved into light that sank into his chest. He took a deep breath and smiled for the first time in weeks. "I feel better," he said. "Like I can handle this."

Clara visited the Moon Garden every night. Each time, she picked a flower for someone who needed it. She helped sick people feel stronger, scared people feel braver, and lonely people feel loved.

Luna told her she was doing good work. "The world needs people like you," she said. "People who use magic to help others, not just themselves."

One night, Luna gave Clara a special gift: a seed from the fountain itself. "Plant this in someone else's yard," Luna said. "Let them discover their own Moon Garden. Magic should be shared."

Clara planted the seed in her teacher's garden. A month later, her teacher told the class about strange, beautiful flowers that glowed at night. Clara smiled but kept the secret. Some magic was better when it was discovered, not explained._The End
