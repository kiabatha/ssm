🐿️ The Chipmunk’s Secret Treasure!

In a European forest lived a chipmunk named Daniel. Daniel loved collecting nuts, but he had a secret. He hid them in a hollow tree, not for himself, but for others.

One autumn, food grew scarce. The animals worried. Daniel opened his hollow tree and shared his treasure. Rabbits, birds, and hedgehogs ate happily. The children who visited the forest clapped. “Daniel’s treasure is kindness!”

The wise owl said, “True treasure is not gold. It is sharing.” Daniel realized that his gift was not collecting, but giving. From that day, his secret treasure became a symbol of care.---The End
