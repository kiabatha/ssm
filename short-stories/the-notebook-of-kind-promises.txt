📓 The Notebook of Kind Promises!

Helena kept a notebook in her European school. She wrote promises: “I will help my friend,” “I will share food.”

Her classmates added their promises too. The notebook grew full of kind words.

The teacher explained, “Promises guide us like lanterns.”

From that day, the Notebook of Kind Promises reminded everyone that kindness grows when promises are kept.__The End
