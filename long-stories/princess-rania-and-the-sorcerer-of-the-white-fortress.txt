This is a tale from ancient times. In the kingdom of Shahaan, there lived a deeply kind-hearted king named Eroz. Not only did he fear God, but his subjects were also very pleased with him. He personally listened to the problems of his people and found solutions for them. As night fell and silence blanketed the land, he would disguise himself as a poor man and venture out to learn about the condition of his subjects.

He used to go from neighborhood to neighborhood, street to street, and to every door. If he found someone hungry, he would feed them. If he saw despair on someone's face, he would comfort them. And if he found someone in need, he would give them gold coins according to their needs. "When he was assured that all the hungry in his kingdom had eaten their fill, the children had happily gone to sleep, and the needs of the poor had been fulfilled, only then would he return to his palace in peace.

However, there was always one sorrow in the heart of this great king. He was constantly worried about who would take care of his people after him, because he had no son who would follow in his footsteps and manage his kingdom with the same love and justice. This thought kept him awake at night." King Nuriz had only one daughter, named Rania.

She was incredibly beautiful, kind-hearted, and wise. Nuriz often shared his worries with his daughter. With her natural love and wisdom, she would comfort her father and say, **"Father, consider me your son. I promise I will take care of the people just as you do."** Rania's words would bring peace to Nuriz's heart, but sometimes he would wonder whether a woman, who had a delicate heart, could bear such a heavy responsibility.

One day, Rania's cat ran towards the hollow trunk of a thick, ancient tree in the garden. Rania followed it. The cat quickly entered the hollow trunk, and Rania chased after it to catch it. But as soon as they both entered the trunk, the tree closed up, trapping them inside. Inside the trunk, Rania saw a strange sight.

In the center of a vast, dark room stood a magnificent throne on which a mysterious queen sat. The queen wore a fine black dress, which looked even more enigmatic in the dim surroundings. She had long, sharp red nails, and a strange smile on her red lips, as if she had been waiting for Rania. The queen’s eyes glowed deeply, and she silently watched Rania.

Rania, both scared and amazed, gathered her courage and asked, **"Who are you? And how did I end up here?"** The queen smiled mysteriously and said, **"I am the one you have been waiting for, Rania. It is no coincidence that you have come here. Your destiny has led you to me."** Rania's heart began to race.

She couldn't understand who this queen was or what her connection to her might be, but it was clear from the queen's words that this encounter marked the beginning of a larger story. Suddenly, a bright light filled the space, stunning Rania with its intensity. In the middle of this light, a golden chest appeared, containing a magical wand and a magical necklace.

The queen then whispered in a voice full of mystery, **"This wand will be one of your greatest weapons. With it, no matter who you face, victory will always be yours. And this necklace... when you wear it, you can travel anywhere you wish, and in moments, you will arrive."** The queen grew serious and continued, Now listen, Rania! These items will be essential to help you with your kingdom and your father’s rule.

But you must fulfill an important promise."** Rania listened carefully and asked, **"What promise?"** The queen replied, **"In the depths of the forest, there is a white fortress, which has been the center of magical powers for centuries. There lies a sorcerer who is regaining his lost powers.

If he succeeds, no one will be able to prevent the world’s destruction. One of my servants informed me that the fortress’s door was open today. It is clear that the sorcerer is close to completing his task. You must go and stop him before he succeeds and destroy him forever."** For a moment, Rania hesitated, but then she gathered her strength and promised the queen that she would help.

As soon as Rania made her promise, she suddenly found herself back in her palace, in her room, as if nothing had happened. But the necklace and wand were still with her, showing that the experience was not a dream, but reality. Rania's challenge had begun. She now had to not only fulfill her father’s responsibilities for the kingdom but also face a dangerous sorcerer who could threaten the world.

She knew that every step on this journey would be crucial and dangerous. That night, Rania wore the magical necklace and wished to be with the poor of her kingdom. In an instant, she was transported to a village of the impoverished. She gave fresh fruits to the hungry, and to the destitute, she gave golden coins.

Once everyone in the village had eaten their fill and was peacefully asleep, Rania breathed a sigh of relief. She then returned to the palace and slept peacefully. The next day, King Airoz received news of these events. He was happy and curious about the kind soul who was helping the people, wondering who this noble person was, but little did he know that it was his own daughter, Rania.

Rania's next mission was to confront the sorcerer. She wore the magical necklace again and said, "O magical necklace, take me to the white fortress." In an instant, she found herself standing outside the eerie white fortress. The fortress doors opened on their own. As soon as Rania entered, she felt as though someone was calling her name.

Suddenly, the sorcerer woke up and rose from his coffin. Rania ran, realizing that she had forgotten the magical wand. The sorcerer’s servants chased her, but using the necklace, Rania quickly returned to the palace. Rania now knew that the sorcerer was real. On the other side, the sorcerer, enraged, had decided to marry Rania so that he could take control of the kingdom.

But he couldn’t figure out where she had gone. So, he used his magic orb to learn her whereabouts. The sorcerer, along with his entire army, soon entered the city. The kingdom was in chaos. The king prepared his army to fight the magical forces, but it was becoming increasingly difficult to face them. Just then, Princess Rania arrived on horseback and waved her magical wand.

Flames erupted from it, destroying the magical army and the sorcerer. She took the sorcerer's head and presented it to her father. When the king heard the full story, he was overjoyed. He was finally at peace, knowing that his own daughter was capable of managing the kingdom with the same love and wisdom he had.
