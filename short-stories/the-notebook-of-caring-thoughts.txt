📓 The Notebook of Caring Thoughts!

Helena kept a notebook in her European school. She wrote caring thoughts each day: “Help a friend,” “Share food,” “Smile kindly.”

Her classmates began writing too. The notebook grew full of gentle ideas. The teacher said, “Caring thoughts become caring actions.”

From that day, the Notebook of Caring Thoughts reminded children that kindness begins with words.__The End
