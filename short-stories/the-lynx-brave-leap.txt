🐆 The Lynx’s Brave Leap!

In the mountains, a lynx named Adrian faced a wide river. He wanted to reach the other side to help a lost lamb. Clara the deer said, “It is too far.” Adrian replied, “Bravery is trying, even when afraid.”

He leapt across, his paws landing safely. The lamb cheered, and Adrian guided it home.

The teacher owl explained, “A brave leap is not about distance, but about courage.”

From that day, Adrian’s leap reminded everyone that bravery is the strongest step._The End
