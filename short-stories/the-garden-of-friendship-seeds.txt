🌱 The Garden of Friendship Seeds!

Children planted seeds in a European garden. Clara said, “This seed is for kindness.” Emil said, “This one is for courage.” Helena said, “This one is for honesty.”

The seeds grew into flowers. The teacher explained, “Friendship grows when planted with care.”
Soon, villagers visited to plant their own seeds.

From that day, the Garden of Friendship Seeds reminded everyone that friendship blooms like petals._The End
