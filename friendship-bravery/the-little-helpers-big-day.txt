The Little Helper’s Big Day!

Hassan loved helping others. One morning, he saw his grandmother carrying a heavy basket. He rushed to take it from her. Later, he noticed his neighbor’s dog had no water. He filled the bowl and patted the dog gently.

At school, his friend dropped pencils. Hassan picked them up quickly. His teacher smiled and said, “You are a true helper.” Hassan felt proud.

That afternoon, the children played football. When one boy fell, Hassan helped him stand. The boy said, “Thank you. You made my day better.”

By evening, Hassan was tired but happy. His grandmother told him, “Helping is a gift. It makes hearts lighter.” Hassan realized that even small acts could make a big difference.
He went to bed smiling, knowing that his day had been full of kindness.
