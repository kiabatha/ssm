🐎 The Stallion’s Honest Heart

In a European countryside lived a stallion named Victor. Victor was strong and admired for his speed, but his greatest gift was honesty.

One day, the villagers planned a race. Some horses whispered, “We can cheat by starting early.” Victor shook his head. “I will run with an honest heart.”

The race began. Victor stayed true to the path, running with steady strength. Others tried shortcuts, but they stumbled. Victor crossed the finish line last, yet the mayor said, “Victor is the true winner. His honest heart shines brighter than speed.”

The children clapped. Victor realized that honesty builds trust. From that day, he became known as the stallion with the honest heart, teaching everyone that truth is stronger than victory.---The End
