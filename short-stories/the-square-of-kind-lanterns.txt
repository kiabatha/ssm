🏮 the square of kind lanterns!

In a European town square, children lit lanterns. Clara said, “Each lantern is a kind act.” Emil added, “They glow when we care.”

The teacher explained, “Kind lanterns guide us like stars.”

Soon, villagers joined. The square became bright with kindness. From that day, the Square of Kind Lanterns reminded everyone that kindness shines._The End
