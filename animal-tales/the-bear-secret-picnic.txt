🐻 The Bear’s Secret Picnic!

In the forests of Germany lived a gentle bear named Otto. Otto loved food, but he also loved sharing. He often gathered berries, honey, and nuts. One day, he decided to prepare a secret picnic for the children of the nearby village.

Otto worked quietly. He spread a blanket under a tall oak tree. He placed baskets of fruit, jars of honey, and fresh bread. Then he hid behind the bushes, waiting. Soon, children playing nearby discovered the picnic. They gasped with delight. “Who made this?” asked Anna. “It must be a kind friend,” said Peter.

The children sat together, eating and laughing. Otto watched with joy. At last, he stepped out. The children clapped. “Otto, you gave us a gift!” He smiled shyly. “I wanted you to feel happy.”

From that day, Otto’s secret picnics became a tradition. Whenever the children found a blanket under the oak tree, they knew Otto had prepared it. The bear learned that kindness is sweetest when shared in secret, and the children learned that friendship can come from unexpected places.---The End
