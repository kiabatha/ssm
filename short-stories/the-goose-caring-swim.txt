🦢 The Goose’s Caring Swim!

In the river, a goose named Clara swam slowly. She guided ducklings across the water. Emil the rabbit said, “Your swim cares for them.” Helena the fox added, “You make the river safe.”

The teacher owl explained, “A caring swim is stronger than waves.”

From that day, Clara’s swim reminded everyone that care can float across rivers._The End
