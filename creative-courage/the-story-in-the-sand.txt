The Story in the Sand!

Layla loved the beach. While others built sandcastles, she drew pictures in the sand—giant suns, swirling waves, and animals with long tails.

One afternoon, she drew a huge picture of a castle with towers and flags. Tourists walked by, smiling. But Layla worried the waves would erase it. “Why bother?” she thought.

Still, she kept drawing. When the tide came in, her castle disappeared. She felt sad—until a woman said, “I took a photo of your art. It was beautiful.”

Layla realized creative courage meant making art even if it doesn’t last.
