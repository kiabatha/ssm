🪞 The Unicorn of Honest Truth!

Children looked into a mirror. A unicorn appeared. Clara admitted, “I was afraid, but I tried.” Emil said, “I shared my bread.” Helena said, “I spoke kindly.” The unicorn’s horn glowed with each truth.

The teacher explained, “Honest truth makes hearts strong.”

Soon, children began writing their truths on paper stars and hanging them around the mirror. The unicorn’s mane glowed brighter with each star.

From that day, the Unicorn of Honest Truth reminded everyone that honesty is magical, and that truth is the strongest reflection._The End
