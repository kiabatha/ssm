🦘 The Kangaroo’s Kind Jump!

In a European circus lived a kangaroo named Felix. Felix was strong and could jump higher than anyone. But he did not use his jumps to show off. He used them to help others.

One evening, the circus tent was crowded. A child dropped her toy high on a shelf. Felix saw her crying. He jumped gracefully, caught the toy, and gave it back. The crowd clapped. “Felix’s jump is kind!”

Soon, Felix used his jumps to help everywhere. He carried baskets, reached tall shelves, and even rescued a bird stuck in a tree. The children loved him. They said, “Felix’s jump is not only strong. It is kind.”

The ringmaster announced, “Felix will perform at the festival.” Felix jumped across the stage, not to impress, but to share joy. He taught everyone that strength is best when used with kindness.

From that day, Felix became known as the kangaroo with the kind jump. His story reminded the circus and the town that true greatness is helping others.---The End
