🪞 The Lake of Honest Reflections!

In a European valley lay a quiet lake. Its water was clear, and reflections showed every detail. Children often visited to see their faces in the water.

One afternoon, Helena looked into the lake. She saw her reflection and whispered, “It shows me as I am.” Emil joined her. He said, “The lake is honest. It does not hide.”

The teacher explained, “Honesty is like water. It reflects truth.” The children realized that the lake taught them to be truthful.

Soon, villagers gathered by the lake. They shared stories and promises. The mayor said, “This lake teaches us that honesty builds trust.”

From that day, the Lake of Honest Reflections became a place where children learned that truth shines clearly, like water in the sun. __The End
