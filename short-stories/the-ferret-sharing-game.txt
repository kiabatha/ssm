🐾 The Ferret’s Sharing Game!

In a meadow, a ferret named Helena found shiny stones. Instead of keeping them, she made a game. Emil the fox and Clara the rabbit joined. They shared stones, laughing together.

The ferret said, “Sharing makes games brighter.”
The teacher owl explained, “A sharing game is the happiest play.”

From that day, Helena’s game reminded everyone that joy grows when shared._The End
