The Secret of the Golden Leaf!

One autumn day, Bilal found a golden leaf under a tree. It shone brightly in the sunlight. He wanted to keep it, but his friend Sara asked if she could hold it too.

Bilal thought for a moment, then shared the leaf. Together, they showed it to their classmates. Each child touched it and smiled. The leaf seemed to glow even brighter.

The teacher said, “This leaf is special because it teaches us that sharing makes beauty grow.”

Bilal realized that the leaf was not just his. It belonged to everyone who shared kindness.
