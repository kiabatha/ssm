🏠 The House of Caring Hearts!

On a hill stood a house decorated with hearts. Clara said, “Each heart is care.” Emil added, “They glow when shared.”

The teacher explained, “Caring hearts are the strongest walls.”

Soon, villagers visited to add their own hearts. From that day, the House of Caring Hearts reminded everyone that care builds homes._The End
