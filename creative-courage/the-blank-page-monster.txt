The Blank Page Monster!

Lily loved stories. She loved reading them, hearing them, and telling them. But today, in the quiet of her room, the empty white page in her new notebook seemed to stare back at her. It was so big, so clean, and so… scary. It was a Blank Page Monster, and its roar was a silent challenge: "Try to fill me. I dare you."

Her pencil felt heavy in her hand. What if her story was boring? What if she used the wrong words? The Monster seemed to grow bigger with every second. She almost closed the notebook. It was safer that way.

But then she remembered her teacher's words: "Every great story begins with a single, brave word."

Lily took a deep breath. She didn't try to write a whole story. She just wrote one word. The first thing she saw. "Window." Then she wrote another. "Sunshine." She drew a little squiggly sun next to it. The Monster didn't seem so scary now. She wrote about the dusty sunbeam on her floor and imagined it was a golden path for a tiny, adventurous ant.

Before she knew it, she had written a whole page about Anty Clara's journey across the vast desert of her bedroom floor. The Blank Page Monster wasn't a monster anymore; it was a world of possibilities, and she had been brave enough to explore it.
