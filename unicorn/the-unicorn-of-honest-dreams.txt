📖 The Unicorn of Honest Dreams!

In the classroom mirror, a unicorn appeared, its mane glowing with colors of dawn. Helena whispered, “I dream of teaching children.” Emil said, “I dream of painting skies.” Clara added, “I dream of helping others.”

The unicorn’s horn glowed with each honest dream, and the mirror reflected not only their faces but their futures. The teacher explained, “Dreams are strongest when spoken truthfully. They guide us like lanterns.”

Children began writing their dreams on paper stars and pinning them around the mirror. Soon, the classroom walls glowed with hope. Villagers visited to add their own dreams, and the unicorn’s mane grew brighter.

From that day, the Unicorn of Honest Dreams reminded everyone that honesty makes dreams shine, and that speaking them aloud is the first step toward making them real._The End
