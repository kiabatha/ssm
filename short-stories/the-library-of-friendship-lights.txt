📚 The Library of Friendship Lights!

In a European town stood a library. One winter, children decorated it with lanterns. Each lantern carried a word: “Care,” “Hope,” “Trust.”

The library glowed warmly. Clara said, “The lights feel like friendship.” Emil nodded. “They guide us to stories.”
Soon, villagers joined. They read books together under the lanterns. The mayor said, “This library teaches us that friendship shines like light.”

From that day, the Library of Friendship Lights became a place of joy.__The End
