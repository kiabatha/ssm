The Robot That Danced!

Omar loved building robots. His classmates built robots that walked, beeped, or carried small objects. Omar’s robot didn’t do any of that—it danced.

He programmed it to spin, wave its arms, and shuffle side to side. At the science fair, kids laughed when they saw it. “That’s not useful!” they said. Omar’s cheeks burned.

But then the robot started dancing to the music playing in the hall. Its movements were clumsy but funny. Soon, children were clapping and dancing along. The laughter turned into cheers.

Omar realized his robot didn’t need to be useful—it needed to bring joy. That was its purpose.
