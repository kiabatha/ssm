😊 The Secret Grove of Smiles!

In a European forest stood a small grove hidden by tall trees. Few villagers knew about it. One day, Clara and Lukas discovered the grove while chasing butterflies.

Inside, they found benches made of stone and flowers blooming in every color. Birds sang happily, and the air felt light. Clara said, “This place makes me smile.” Lukas nodded. “It feels like joy lives here.”

The children invited their friends. Soon, the grove filled with laughter. They played games, shared bread, and told stories. The teacher explained, “Smiles are gifts. They grow stronger when shared.”

The villagers later visited. They decorated the grove with lanterns and held gatherings. From that day, the Secret Grove of Smiles became a place where joy and kindness bloomed together.---The End
