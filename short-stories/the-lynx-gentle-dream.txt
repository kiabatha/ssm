In the forest, a lynx named Adrian dreamed of peace. He did not dream of hunting. He dreamed of animals living together. Clara the deer said, “Your dream is gentle.” Emil the rabbit added, “It makes us hopeful.”

The teacher owl explained, “A gentle dream is the first step to kindness.”

From that day, Adrian’s dream reminded everyone that gentleness can guide even the strongest hearts._The End
