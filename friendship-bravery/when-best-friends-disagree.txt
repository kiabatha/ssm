Lily and Zoe did everything together. They built pillow forts, dreamed of being astronauts, and shared their secret fears. But today, a dark cloud hung between them. Their school was holding a poster-making competition, and they both wanted to design it.

“A space theme is the best! Planets, rockets, stars!” Lily argued, her voice rising.

“No, an under-the-sea theme! Oceans, mermaids, treasure!” Zoe shot back, her hands on her hips.

They stood in silence, both feeling hurt. Lily thought, If she was my real friend, she’d agree with me. Zoe felt the same way. For the first time, recess ended without them speaking a word.

That evening, Lily felt a hollow space in her heart. She missed Zoe. She took out her crayons and drew two posters. On one, she drew an astronaut discovering a magical underwater castle. On the other, a mermaid finding a glowing spaceship.

The next day, she showed them to Zoe. “What if we combine them?” Lily asked softly. “Our ideas don’t have to fight. They can be friends, just like us.”

Zoe’s eyes lit up. “A space ocean!” she exclaimed. “It’s perfect!”

They worked together, blending rockets with seashells and aliens with friendly fish. Their poster won first prize, but the real victory was learning that true friendship isn’t about always agreeing—it’s about finding a way to build something new together.
