🚪 The School Gate of Kindness!

At the gate of a European school, children greeted each other with smiles. Clara said, “Kindness begins here.”

Soon, children began helping each other at the gate. They carried bags and welcomed new friends.
The teacher explained, “Kindness is the best way to enter learning.”

From that day, the School Gate of Kindness reminded everyone that kindness opens doors.__The End
