The Puzzle We Solved Together!

Bilal brought a big puzzle to school. It had one hundred pieces and showed a picture of a castle. He tried to solve it alone, but it was too hard.

Sara joined him, then Amir, then more friends. Each child picked up a piece and tried to find where it fit. Slowly, the puzzle began to take shape. The children laughed when pieces matched and clapped when the castle grew taller.

At last, they placed the final piece together. The puzzle was complete. The children cheered. Bilal said, “I could not have done this alone. Friendship made the puzzle possible.”

The children realized that teamwork is like solving a puzzle. Each person adds a piece, and together they make something beautiful.
