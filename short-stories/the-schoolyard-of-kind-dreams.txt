🌙 The Schoolyard of Kind Dreams!

Children in a European schoolyard often spoke about their dreams. Helena dreamed of teaching. Emil dreamed of painting. Clara dreamed of helping others.

The teacher explained, “Kind dreams guide kind lives.”

Soon, children began sharing dreams every morning. The schoolyard became a place of hope.

From that day, the Schoolyard of Kind Dreams reminded everyone that kindness begins with dreams.__The End
