🕊️ The Dove’s Peaceful Gift!

In a European village lived a dove named Helena. Helena flew gently above the rooftops. She carried olive branches in her beak, dropping them at doors.

One spring, the villagers argued about land. Helena flew between them, leaving branches. The children noticed and said, “Her gift is peace.” The mayor declared, “Helena reminds us that peace is stronger than anger.”

From that day, Helena’s peaceful gift became a tradition. Whenever disputes arose, villagers remembered the dove and chose kindness.---The End
