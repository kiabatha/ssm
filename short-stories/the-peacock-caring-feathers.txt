🦚 The Peacock’s Caring Feathers!

In a garden, a peacock named Helena spread her feathers. She did not show them for pride. She used them to shelter smaller birds from rain. Emil the sparrow said, “Your feathers care for us.” Clara the rabbit added, “They are brighter because they are kind.”

The teacher owl explained, “Caring feathers shine more than jewels.”

From that day, Helena’s feathers reminded everyone that beauty grows when shared._The End
