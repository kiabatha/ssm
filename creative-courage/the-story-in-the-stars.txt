The Story in the Stars!

Ali loved looking at the night sky. He imagined stories in the constellations—warriors, animals, and magical lands. For the lantern festival, he decorated his lantern with drawings of these stories.

At the festival, other lanterns glowed with neat patterns and perfect designs. Ali’s lantern looked messy, covered with wild drawings. He felt ashamed. But when the lanterns were lit, his glowed with color and imagination. Children gathered around, pointing at the pictures. “Look! A dragon!” one shouted.

Ali smiled. His lantern wasn’t perfect, but it told a story. That was enough.
