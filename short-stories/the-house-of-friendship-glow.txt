🏠 The House of Friendship Glow!

On a hill stood a house filled with lanterns. Each lantern carried a friendship. Clara said, “It shines when shared.” Emil added, “It warms us when we care.”

The teacher explained, “Friendship glow is the brightest light.”

Soon, villagers visited to add their own lanterns.

From that day, the House of Friendship Glow reminded everyone that friendship lights the world._The End
