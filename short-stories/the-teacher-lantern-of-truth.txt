🏮 The Teacher’s Lantern of Truth!

Madame Clara carried a lantern during evening lessons. She said, “This lantern is truth. It lights our way.”

Children shared honest stories under its glow. Emil said, “Truth makes us strong.” Clara nodded.

From that day, the Teacher’s Lantern of Truth reminded everyone that honesty guides learning.__The End
