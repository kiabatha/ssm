The Inventor's Mistakes!

Tobias loved building things, but nothing he built ever worked right. He made a robot that kept falling over. He built a bridge that collapsed under the weight of his toy cars. He designed a flying machine that crashed into a tree.

His older brother laughed at him. "You are terrible at inventing," he said.

Tobias felt discouraged. Maybe his brother was right.

His grandmother visited that weekend. She saw Tobias sitting sadly in his room, surrounded by broken inventions. "What is wrong?" she asked.

Tobias explained. His grandmother picked up the broken robot. "Tell me about this," she said.

"I wanted it to walk, but the legs were too weak," Tobias said. "I failed."

"Did you learn why it fell?" his grandmother asked.

"Yes. The legs needed to be thicker and the weight needed to be distributed better."

"Then you did not fail," his grandmother said. "You learned. That is how inventing works. Thomas Edison tried thousands of materials before he found the right one for the light bulb. Every mistake taught him something."

She showed Tobias her own notebook from when she was young. It was filled with drawings of inventions that did not work.
 
"I wanted to be an engineer," she said. "I failed many times. But each failure taught me something. Eventually, I designed bridges that are still standing today."

Tobias looked at his broken inventions differently. They were not failures. They were lessons.

He rebuilt the robot with thicker legs and better balance. It walked across his room without falling. He rebuilt the bridge with stronger supports and better weight distribution. His toy cars drove over it easily. He redesigned the flying machine with better wings and a lighter frame. It glided smoothly through the air.

Each invention worked because he had learned from his mistakes.

At school, his teacher assigned an invention project. Most students got frustrated when their first ideas did not work perfectly. They wanted to give up.

Tobias told them about his grandmother and Edison. "Mistakes are part of learning," he said. "If your invention does not work, ask yourself why. Then fix it. That is what inventors do."

His classmates kept trying. Slowly, their inventions improved. They learned that success came from persistence, not perfection.

The teacher was impressed. "Tobias, you taught everyone an important lesson," she said. "Failure is not the opposite of success. It is part of the path to success."

Tobias kept inventing. Not everything worked, but he no longer felt bad about mistakes. He knew each one brought him closer to something great.

Years later, Tobias became an engineer. He designed machines that helped people. When young engineers came to him feeling discouraged, he showed them his old notebook full of broken designs. "These mistakes made me who I am," he said. "Do not fear failure. Learn from it."_The End
