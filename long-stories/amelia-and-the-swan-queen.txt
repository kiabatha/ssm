Once upon a time, in a lush and verdant area, there was a small, beautiful village where a mother and daughter lived. The mother fell gravely ill, and no treatment seemed to help her. "I don't think I can live much longer," mother said. Amelia, who was listening to all this, felt very sad.

However, she didn't show her sadness in front of her mother. She made a decision in her heart that she would do whatever it took to make her mother well again. "Here, mother, I’ve made some hot soup. Drink it; it will bring you comfort. I’ve also heard about the Swan Queen, who is said to have a cure for every illness.

I will go to meet her, and you’ll see—you will surely get better." So, Amelia packed a small bag with food, water, and a blanket and set off on her journey. She was heading deep into the magical forest. She had heard rumors about a place within this dark and mysterious forest where the "Swan Queen" resided.
 
It was said that she was not only a master of magic but also possessed the secret to curing illnesses. With hope and determination shining in her heart, Amelia was resolute in her quest to find this miraculous help for her mother. After traveling for some time, Amelia came across a strange sight. She saw Humpty Dumpty** sitting on a wall, with cracks spread across his egg-like shell.
 
He looked sad and weary. "Is there anyone kind enough to help me?" humpty dumpty called out. Amelia approached him and climbed up the wall to sit beside him. Humpty Dumpty let out a deep sigh and began to tell his story. Humpty Dumpty shared his story: One day, his mother, Henlen, laid eggs. At that time, a beautiful fairy was passing by.
 
The mother requested the fairy to use her magic to turn one of the eggs into a living creature. Smiling, the fairy touched the egg, and thus, Humpty Dumpty came to life. Filled with joy, the mother presented him as a gift to the princess. The princess was delighted to see him. One day, she placed him on a high wall so he could watch the king's horses and soldiers.
 
Unfortunately, he lost his balance and fell. The fall left cracks on his egg-like shell. This saddened his mother deeply, and she vowed never to make such a request to fairies again. Amelia began mending Humpty Dumpty's cracks. She told him she was on a quest to find the Swan Queen to get medicine for her sick mother.
 
Humpty Dumpty sighed deeply and said, "The path ahead is broken. You will need to piece together puzzle-like stones to create a new path that will lead you to your destination." Following his instructions, Amelia worked on assembling the stones into a pathway. Once it was complete, she resumed her journey.
 
After traveling for a while, Amelia came upon a unique house made of a giant pumpkin. From outside, she heard the sounds of an argument. Curious, she approached the door and gently knocked. When no one answered, she stepped inside. The interior was breathtaking. The pumpkin's soft orange glow illuminated the walls, and the furniture was carved from pure gold.
 
Everything was so exquisite and magical, it seemed like a dream. However, the enchanting atmosphere was in stark contrast to the loud argument between a husband and wife inside. The wife was yelling, "I’m tired of living in this pumpkin house! Eating bland pumpkin every day has made life so dull!" The husband, whose name was Peter Pumpkin, was trying to remain calm, but his exhaustion was evident.
 
Amelia softly said, "Please stop fighting. I’m here to help." Both of them fell silent and looked at her with hopeful eyes. Amelia went into the kitchen, where everything was made of pumpkins. Using her creativity, she prepared a few unique dishes, including pumpkin pie and pumpkin smoothies.
 
The aroma alone brought smiles to their faces. When they sat down to eat, they enjoyed the meal with great enthusiasm and thanked Amelia. She advised them, "When problems arise, it’s important to find solutions, not vent anger at each other." They agreed with her wisdom and praised her insight.
 
When Amelia told them about her journey to meet the Swan Queen for her mother’s medicine, Peter Pumpkin said, "You’ll find a golden gate ahead. I am its guardian. Here, take the key." Thanking him, Amelia continued her journey. The couple waved goodbye, blessing her as she departed. Walking further, Amelia reached the golden gate, which sparkled in the sunlight.
 
She used the key Peter Pumpkin had given her and opened it. The sight beyond left her in awe—a magnificent meadow surrounded by a crystal-clear lake, with elegant white swans gracefully gliding across its waters. Suddenly, one of the swans emerged from the water and approached her. Bowing its head, it gestured for her to climb on its back.
 
Amelia did so, and the swan flew through the clouds, carrying her across the lake to a hilltop where a grand palace stood. The palace glimmered with a magical radiance, as if it belonged to a fairy tale. Inside, Amelia met the Swan Queen, who was breathtakingly beautiful. Her voice was soft and soothing.
 
After listening to Amelia’s story, the Swan Queen smiled and said, "You have shown courage, intelligence, and kindness throughout your journey. As a reward, I give you this gift." She handed Amelia a small vial containing a glowing liquid. "This medicine will heal your mother." Amelia thanked the Swan Queen and began her journey back home, her heart brimming with joy and hope.
 
When she arrived, she went straight to her mother and gave her the medicine. As soon as her mother drank it, the illness vanished. Her strength returned, and she stood on her feet once more. Their joy knew no bounds. That year’s Christmas was special for both mother and daughter. After a long time, they decorated their home, prepared delicious meals, and celebrated the festival with immense happiness.
