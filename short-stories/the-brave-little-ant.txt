Once there was a tiny ant named Nimo.
One morning, Nimo wandered too far from the colony while chasing a shiny pebble. Suddenly, he realized he was lost. The forest around him was big and full of strange sounds.
Nimo didn’t cry. He remembered what the elder ants had taught him: “Stay calm. Look for signs.” So he followed the scent of crushed leaves and tiny footprints. Along the way, he helped a beetle flip over and shared crumbs with a tired caterpillar.
After a long journey, Nimo saw the hill where his colony lived. The ants cheered when he returned. Nimo wasn’t just brave—he was kind too.
