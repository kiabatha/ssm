🌈 The Unicorn of Kind Wishes!

In a quiet meadow beyond the village, children discovered a unicorn with a silver horn that shimmered like moonlight. Clara approached first, whispering, “I wish for kindness to fill our school.” The unicorn’s horn glowed softly. Emil added, “I wish for courage to stand up for truth.” Helena said, “I wish for peace among friends.”

The unicorn lowered its head, and each wish became a glowing star that floated into the sky. The children watched in awe as the meadow filled with light. The teacher explained, “Kind wishes are the strongest magic. They do not change the world at once, but they change hearts.”

Soon, villagers came to the meadow to share their own wishes. Some wished for health, others for joy, and some for forgiveness. The unicorn’s horn glowed brighter with every kind word.

From that day, the Unicorn of Kind Wishes reminded everyone that kindness is the greatest spell, and that even the smallest wish can light the darkest night._The End
