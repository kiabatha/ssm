🐦 The Sparrow’s Kind Flight!

In a European town lived a sparrow named Luca. Luca loved flying above the rooftops. One winter, he noticed children dropping crumbs of bread. He picked them up and carried them to birds who had no food.

The other sparrows asked, “Why do you share?” Luca replied, “Kindness makes wings lighter.” Soon, more birds joined him. Together, they carried food to hungry animals.

The children saw this and clapped. “Luca’s flight is kind.” The teacher said, “He teaches us that sharing is a gift.”

From that day, Luca’s kind flight became a symbol of care. He reminded everyone that kindness spreads like wings in the sky.---The End
