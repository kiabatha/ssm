🐑 The Lamb’s Caring Song!

In a European hillside farm lived a lamb named Anna. Anna had a gentle voice. She loved humming softly while grazing. Her song carried warmth, and the children often listened with smiles.

One spring, the village faced sadness. The crops failed, and the farmers worried. Anna walked to the square and sang her caring song. The melody was simple, but it lifted hearts. The baker smiled, the teacher relaxed, and the children laughed again.

The mayor said, “Anna’s song is caring. It reminds us of hope.” Anna realized that her gift was not strength, but comfort. From that day, she sang whenever someone felt sad, teaching the village that care can be shared through even the smallest voice.---The End
