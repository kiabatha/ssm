🪨 The Cave of Courage!

In a European hillside lay a dark cave. Few children entered because it looked deep and silent. One day, Lukas and Helena decided to explore. They carried lanterns and held hands.

At first, the cave felt cold. Shadows moved across the walls. Helena whispered, “I feel afraid.” Lukas said, “Courage means walking forward even when fear is near.”

Step by step, they moved inside. They found drawings on the stone walls, made long ago by villagers. The pictures showed hunters, dancers, and families. Helena smiled. “The cave tells stories of brave people.”

When they returned to the village, the teacher explained, “Courage is not about being strong. It is about facing challenges with hope.”

From that day, the Cave of Courage reminded children that bravery grows when hearts are kind and steady.---The End
