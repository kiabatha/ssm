🐅 The Tiger’s Kind Roar!

In a European forest lived a tiger named Leonora. Leonora was strong and fierce, but she had a kind heart. Her roar was powerful, yet she used it not to scare, but to protect.

One summer, children played near the forest. Suddenly, a storm approached. The wind grew strong, and branches fell. Leonora climbed to a hill and roared loudly. Her roar echoed through the valley, warning everyone to find shelter. The children ran safely to the village.

The villagers said, “Leonora’s roar is kind. It saves us.” From that day, she used her roar to guide, not to frighten. She roared to call lost animals, to warn of danger, and to celebrate festivals.

Leonora realized that strength is greatest when used with kindness. Her roar became a symbol of care. The children whispered, “Leonora teaches us that even the strongest voice can be gentle.”---The End
