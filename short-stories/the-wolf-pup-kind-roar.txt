🐺 The Wolf Pup’s Kind Roar!

In the forest, a wolf pup named Adrian had a loud roar. He did not use it to scare. He used it to call friends together. Clara the deer said, “Your roar is kind.” Emil the rabbit added, “It makes us feel safe.”

The teacher owl explained, “A kind roar is stronger than anger.”

From that day, Adrian’s roar reminded everyone that kindness can be loud too._The End
