🪨 The Path Of Silver Stones!

Near a European forest lay a narrow path. The stones on the path shone silver in the sunlight. Children often walked there, wondering why the stones glowed.

One afternoon, Adrian and Sofia followed the path. They noticed that each stone was smooth and bright. Sofia said, “The stones look like stars on the ground.”

At the end of the path, they found a small spring. Water flowed gently over the stones, making them shine. The children filled their bottles and laughed. “The path leads to water and hope,” said Adrian.

The teacher explained, “The stones remind us that light can guide us, even on small paths.”

From that day, the Path of Silver Stones became a favorite walk for villagers. It taught them that even small steps can lead to bright discoveries.---The End
