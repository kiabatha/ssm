🗣️ The Hill of Honest Voices!

In a European town stood a grassy hill. Villagers gathered there to share stories. They called it the Hill of Honest Voices.

One afternoon, Emil climbed the hill with his friends. He told a story about helping his grandmother. Clara shared how she returned a lost book to the library. Each child spoke honestly, and the group clapped.

The teacher said, “Honest voices make trust strong.” The children realized that the hill was special. It was not about shouting or boasting. It was about speaking truth with kindness.

Soon, the villagers held weekly gatherings. They sang, told stories, and listened carefully. The hill became a place of respect.

From that day, the Hill of Honest Voices reminded everyone that honesty builds friendship. __The End
