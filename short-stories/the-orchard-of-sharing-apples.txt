🍎 The Orchard of Sharing Apples!

In a European village stood a wide orchard filled with apple trees. The orchard belonged to Madame Helena, who cared for the trees with love. Every autumn, the branches bent low with red apples.

One year, the harvest was greater than ever. Helena invited the children to help. Lukas, Clara, and Emil carried baskets. They picked apples carefully and filled them with joy. Helena said, “These apples are not only for us. They are for everyone.”

The children walked through the village, giving apples to neighbors. They shared with the baker, the teacher, and even travelers passing by. Smiles spread across faces. Clara whispered, “Sharing makes the apples sweeter.”

At the autumn fair, the villagers gathered in the orchard. They sang songs and told stories. The mayor said, “This orchard teaches us that kindness grows when we share.”

From that day, the Orchard of Sharing Apples became a place of friendship and hope.---The End
