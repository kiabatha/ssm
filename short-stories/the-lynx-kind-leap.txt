🐆 The Lynx’s Kind Leap!

In the mountains, a lynx named Adrian leapt across rocks. He slowed his leap so smaller animals could follow. Clara the deer said, “Your leap is kind.” Emil the rabbit added, “It makes us safe.”

The teacher owl explained, “A kind leap is stronger than speed.”
From that day, Adrian’s leap reminded everyone that kindness can guide even strong steps._The End
