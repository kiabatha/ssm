🌟 The Market of Honest Stars!

In a European town square, children decorated the market with stars. Clara said, “Each star is a truth.” Emil added, “They shine when spoken honestly.”

The teacher explained, “Honest stars guide us like lanterns.”

Soon, villagers joined. The market became a place of trust. From that day, the Market of Honest Stars reminded everyone that honesty shines like starlight._The End
