The Found Wallet!

Chloe was walking in the park when she spotted a wallet under a bench. Inside were bills, a driver’s license, and family photos. Her friends whispered, “We could buy ice cream with this money.”

Chloe’s heart pounded. It was tempting, but she imagined how worried the owner must be. She picked up the wallet and walked straight to the police station.

The officer smiled. “You did the right thing.” The next day, the wallet’s owner came to thank her. “This money was for my daughter’s school fees. You saved us.”

Chloe realized moral courage meant resisting temptation and choosing honesty.
