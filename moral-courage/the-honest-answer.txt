Lila forgot her homework. She thought about lying, saying she left it at home. Her friends whispered, “Just make an excuse.”
When the teacher asked, Lila’s heart pounded. She took a deep breath and said, “I didn’t do it. I forgot.”

The class grew quiet. The teacher nodded and said, “Thank you for being honest. That’s brave.”
Lila didn’t escape punishment, but she felt lighter. She realized moral courage meant telling the truth, even when it’s hard.
