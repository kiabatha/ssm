The Broken Window!

The crack in Mr. Peterson’s window pane looked like a giant spiderweb. It stared back at Sam, a silent witness to his mistake. He and Leo had just been playing catch, and one wild throw was all it took. The thud of the ball against the glass was a sound Sam knew he would never forget.

Leo’s eyes were wide with fear. “No one saw us! Let’s just run!” he whispered urgently, already starting to back away.

Sam’s heart hammered against his ribs. Running away was the easiest thing to do. Mr. Peterson was the strictest neighbor on the block. But as Sam looked at the broken glass, he felt a heavy weight in his stomach. It was the weight of the secret they would have to keep.

He thought about his dad’s words: “Courage is doing the right thing, even when it’s scary.”

“No, Leo,” Sam said, his voice shaky but firm. “We can’t run. It was our fault.”

Taking a deep breath, Sam walked up the path to Mr. Peterson’s front door, the guilty baseball clutched in his hand. Leo followed reluctantly. Sam rang the bell, the chime sounding like a gong of doom.

When Mr. Peterson opened the door, his stern expression made Sam’s knees feel weak. “Mr. Peterson,” Sam stammered, holding up the ball. “We broke your window. It was an accident. We’re very sorry.”

He braced for a shout, but it never came. Mr. Peterson looked from their scared faces to the broken window and back. “That took guts, boys,” he said, his voice much softer than expected. “Admitting fault is harder than hiding it. Now, how do you plan to fix it?”

Relief washed over Sam. He and Leo promised to pay for the new window from their pocket money by doing extra chores. Walking home, the heavy weight in Sam’s stomach was gone, replaced by a clean, proud feeling. He had learned that a cracked window could be fixed, but a cracked conscience was much harder to repair.
