🏔️ The Mountain of Brave Steps!

In a European village stood a tall mountain. The villagers called it the Mountain of Brave Steps. Few children had climbed it, because the path was steep and rocky.

One summer, a boy named Adrian wanted to try. His sister Sofia joined him. They carried small bags with bread and water. At the first hill, Adrian felt tired. Sofia said, “Take one step at a time.”

They climbed slowly. Birds flew above, and goats grazed nearby. The children counted each step. “One, two, three,” they said together. When the path grew narrow, Adrian felt afraid. Sofia held his hand. “Bravery is walking forward even when fear is near.”

At last, they reached the top. The village spread below them, shining in the sun. The children laughed with joy. The mayor later said, “Adrian and Sofia teach us that brave steps build strong hearts.”

From that day, the mountain became a place where children learned courage, one step at a time.---The End
