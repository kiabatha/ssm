🏮 The Path of Brave Lanterns!

In a European village, children prepared for a night walk. They carried lanterns made of paper and wood. The path through the forest was dark, but the lanterns glowed brightly.

Helena led the group. She said, “Bravery is not walking alone. It is walking together.” Emil held his lantern high, and Clara guided the younger children.

As they walked, the lanterns lit the trees and stones. The children sang softly. The forest felt safe. When they reached the meadow, they placed the lanterns in a circle. The light shone like stars.

The teacher explained, “Brave hearts shine when they help others.” The children realized that the lanterns were more than light. They were symbols of courage.

From that day, the Path of Brave Lanterns became a tradition, teaching children that bravery grows when shared.---The End
