🐪 The Camel’s Gentle Journey!

In a European desert town lived a camel named Elias. Elias carried heavy loads across the sand, but he always walked gently. He never rushed, and he never complained. His calm steps made travelers feel safe.

One summer, a family needed to cross the desert. They worried about the heat and the long road. Elias knelt down and let them climb on his back. He walked slowly, stopping often to rest. He shared his water and shade. The children whispered, “Elias is gentle. He makes the journey easy.”

After many days, they reached the town safely. The family thanked Elias. The mayor said, “Your gentle journey teaches us patience and care.” Elias bowed his head humbly. He realized that kindness is not about speed. It is about walking with love.

From that day, Elias became known as the camel of the gentle journey. His story reminded everyone that patience and care make every path brighter.---The End
