The Sleepy Rainbow!

In Ireland, Sean saw a rainbow appear at night. It was sleepy, bending low across the hills. Sean climbed gently onto its colors, sliding across red, blue, and gold. The rainbow carried him into dreams where kindness painted every sky. He met children who shared laughter across the colors, and together they built bridges of joy. When dawn arrived, the rainbow faded, but Sean woke with hope, knowing that dreams can carry colors into the heart.
