🪑 The Desk of Friendship!

In a European classroom stood a wooden desk. Lukas and Clara shared it. They helped each other with lessons and shared bread at lunch.

The teacher said, “Friendship makes learning easier.” Soon, children began sharing desks with joy.

From that day, the Desk of Friendship reminded everyone that friendship is the strongest support.__The End
