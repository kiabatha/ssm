🌼 The Meadow of Golden Dreams!

Near a European village stretched a wide meadow. In summer, golden flowers covered the field. The villagers called it the Meadow of Golden Dreams.

Children loved to run through the flowers. One day, Lukas and Helena lay on the grass, looking at the sky. Lukas said, “This meadow feels magical.” Helena nodded. “It gives us dreams.”

That night, Lukas dreamed of becoming a painter. Helena dreamed of becoming a teacher. They told their parents, who smiled. “The meadow gives hope,” said the elder.

The children decided to plant more flowers. Soon, the meadow grew brighter. Villagers visited to rest and dream. The mayor said, “This meadow teaches us that dreams grow when we care for them.”

From that day, the Meadow of Golden Dreams became a place where children found courage to imagine their future. __The End
