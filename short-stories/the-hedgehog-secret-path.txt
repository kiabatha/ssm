🌿 The Hedgehog’s Secret Path!

In a quiet forest, a hedgehog named Sofia discovered a hidden path under the leaves. She followed it carefully, her small paws brushing against soft moss. Along the way, she met Lukas the rabbit, who asked, “Where does this path lead?” Sofia smiled, “It is a secret, but I think it leads to kindness.”

Together they walked, helping each other over stones and through tall grass. When they reached the end, they found a clearing filled with wildflowers. The animals of the forest gathered there, each bringing something to share. The hedgehog’s secret path had led them to a place of friendship.

The teacher owl explained, “Sometimes the smallest paths lead to the greatest treasures.”

From that day, Sofia’s path reminded everyone that kindness is the best secret._The End
