Leo loved recess more than anything. The playground was his kingdom. He knew which bar on the jungle gym was slightly loose, the exact spot on the slide that made you go fastest, and the best hiding place for hide-and-seek. But today, something felt different.

A boy he had never seen before stood all alone by the old oak tree, kicking at a pile of fallen leaves with his worn-out sneakers. He looked small and out of place. Leo remembered seeing him in Mrs. Clay's class that morning, introduced as Sam. He had barely said a word.

"Leo, come on! Tag! You're it!" shouted his friend Mia from the monkey bars.

Leo's eyes darted from his laughing friends to the lonely boy. A nervous flutter filled his tummy. What if I go over and he ignores me? What if my friends think I'm weird for talking to the new kid? The safe choice was to run to his friends. But seeing Sam standing there, looking so lost, made Leo feel sad.
He took a deep breath, puffing out his chest a little. Be brave, he told himself.

He walked across the chips, his heart beating a little faster. "Hi," he said, stopping a few feet away so he didn't scare him. "I'm Leo. From your class."
Sam looked up, his eyes wide with surprise. "Oh. Hi," he mumbled, looking back at the ground.

"It's okay if you don't know anyone yet," Leo said kindly. "Do you want to play tag with us? We need one more person to make the teams even." It was a little white lie, but it felt like a good one.

Sam shuffled his feet. "I... I don't really know how to play the way you do here."

"That's easy! I can be your teammate and show you," Leo said, his smile feeling more real now. "It's the most fun game, I promise."

He led a hesitant Sam over to the group. "Guys, this is Sam. He's going to be on my team."

There was a moment of quiet. Then, Mia smiled. "Cool! The more the merrier. Sam, you can start as the 'not it' person."
The game began. At first, Sam was slow and unsure, but Leo ran beside him, showing him the best ways to dodge. Soon, Sam was laughing, his earlier sadness completely gone. When the bell rang, Sam fell into step beside Leo.
