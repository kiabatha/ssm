🗣️ The Square of Brave Voices!

In a European town square, children stood and spoke bravely. Clara said, “I will help.” Emil said, “I will share.” Helena said, “I will speak the truth.”

The teacher explained, “Brave voices make towns strong.”

Soon, villagers joined. The square echoed with courage.

From that day, the Square of Brave Voices reminded everyone that bravery can be heard._The End
