🌸 The Garden of Friendship!

In a European village stood a small garden. Clara and Emil planted flowers together. They watered them daily and shared tools. Soon, the garden bloomed with colors.

The teacher said, “Friendship grows like flowers. It needs care.”
From that day, the Garden of Friendship reminded everyone that kindness makes beauty bloom._The End
