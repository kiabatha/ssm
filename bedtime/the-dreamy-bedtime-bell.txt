The Dreamy Bedtime Bell!

In Germany, Lukas found a bell beside his bed. Each night it rang softly, carrying him into dreams. The sound opened doors to gardens of stars, rivers of light, and castles filled with laughter. Lukas walked through them, meeting children who shared joy. The bell whispered that every sound of kindness can echo across the world. When morning came, Lukas woke with hope, knowing the bedtime bell would always guide him gently into sleep.
