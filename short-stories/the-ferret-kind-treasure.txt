🐾 The Ferret’s Kind Treasure

In the meadow, a ferret named Clara found a golden leaf. She could have kept it, but she shared it with friends. Emil the rabbit said, “Your treasure is kind.” Helena the fox added, “It shines brighter when shared.”

The teacher owl explained, “A kind treasure is the greatest gift.”

From that day, Clara’s treasure reminded everyone that kindness makes treasures glow._The End
