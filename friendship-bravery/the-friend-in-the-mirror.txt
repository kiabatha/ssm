The Friend in the Mirror!

Amir often looked in the mirror and wished he could be taller or faster. One day, his sister said, “The mirror shows your best friend. Be kind to him.”

Amir thought about her words. He began to smile at his reflection and say, “You are enough. You are brave. You are kind.”

Soon, he felt happier. His friends noticed and asked why he was smiling more. Amir explained, “I learned to be a friend to myself. When I am kind to me, I can be kind to you too.”

The children realized that friendship begins inside. When you respect yourself, you can respect others.
