🌉 The Bridge of Honest Work!

In a European town stood a bridge. Workers built it with honesty. They measured carefully, carried stones fairly, and spoke truthfully.

Children admired the bridge. Clara said, “Honest work makes bridges strong.” Emil added, “Truth builds trust.”

Soon, villagers crossed the bridge proudly. From that day, the Bridge of Honest Work reminded everyone that honesty is the strongest foundation._The End
