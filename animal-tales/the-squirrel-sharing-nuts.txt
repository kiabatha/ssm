🐿️ The Squirrel’s Sharing Nuts!

In a European forest lived a busy squirrel named Clara. Clara loved collecting nuts. She stored them in a hollow tree, counting each one carefully. She believed that hard work kept her safe.

One cold autumn, Clara noticed other animals struggling. A hedgehog had no food. A bird had no seeds. Clara thought, “I have many nuts. I should share.” She carried baskets of nuts to her friends. The hedgehog smiled. The bird sang with joy.

Soon, more animals came. Clara gave nuts to everyone. Her hollow tree grew empty, but her heart grew full. The children of the nearby village saw her kindness. They said, “Clara teaches us that sharing makes us rich in friendship.”

Winter passed, and Clara’s friends returned the kindness. They brought her berries, seeds, and warmth. Clara realized that sharing builds a circle of care. She learned that true wealth is not in what you keep, but in what you give.

From that day, Clara became known as the squirrel of sharing nuts. Her story reminded everyone that kindness multiplies when shared.---The End
