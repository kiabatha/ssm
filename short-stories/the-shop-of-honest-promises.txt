🏪 The Shop of Honest Promises!

In a European town stood a shop where promises were given freely. Clara said, “I will help.” Emil said, “I will share.” Helena said, “I will speak kindly.”

The shop glowed with honesty. The teacher explained, “Promises are strongest when kept.”
Soon, villagers visited to make their own promises.

From that day, the Shop of Honest Promises reminded everyone that honesty is the best gift._The End
