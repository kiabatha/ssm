🌸 The Hedgehog’s Caring Hug!

A hedgehog named Helena had sharp spines, but she learned to hug gently. Clara the rabbit said, “Your hug feels safe.” Emil the fox added, “It shows care.”

The teacher owl explained, “A caring hug warms more than fire.”

From that day, Helena’s hug reminded everyone that care can be soft even when we are strong._The End
