🐆 The Lynx’s Caring Steps!

In the mountains, a lynx named Adrian walked carefully. He slowed his steps so smaller animals could follow. Clara the deer said, “Your steps care for us.” Emil the rabbit added, “They make us safe.”

The teacher owl explained, “Caring steps guide friends farther than fast ones.”

From that day, Adrian’s steps reminded everyone that care makes journeys strong._The End
