🌷 The Garden of Caring Hands!

In a European village stood a small garden near the school. It was plain and quiet. One day, Lukas suggested, “Let us make it bright.”

The children brought seeds, tools, and water. Clara planted flowers, Emil trimmed bushes, and Helena watered the soil. Together they worked with caring hands.

Soon, the garden bloomed with colors. Butterflies danced, and bees hummed. The teacher said, “This garden shows that care makes beauty.”

The villagers visited and rested on benches. They felt peace. The mayor said, “The garden teaches us that kindness grows when we work together.”

From that day, the Garden of Caring Hands became a place of joy, reminding everyone that care creates hope.---The End
