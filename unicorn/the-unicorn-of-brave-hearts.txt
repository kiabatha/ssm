🧪 The Unicorn of Brave Hearts!

Children mixed berries into a potion. The unicorn drank and glowed. Lukas said, “Bravery is helping.” Helena added, “Bravery is caring.” Emil said, “Bravery is truth.”

The teacher explained, “Brave hearts are the strongest strength.”

Soon, children began writing brave acts on paper hearts and placing them in jars. The unicorn touched each jar, making it glow.

From that day, the Unicorn of Brave Hearts reminded everyone that courage is not loud but gentle, and that bravery grows when shared._The End
