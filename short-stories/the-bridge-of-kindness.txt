🌉 The Bridge of Kindness!

In a European town stood a stone bridge across the river. Children crossed it every day on their way to school.

One morning, Lukas saw an old man struggling to carry a basket. He helped him across the bridge. The man smiled. “This bridge feels kinder because of you.”

Soon, other children began helping too. They carried books, guided younger friends, and shared food. The bridge became a place of kindness.

The mayor said, “This bridge teaches us that kindness is the strongest path.” The villagers decorated it with flowers.

From that day, the Bridge of Kindness reminded everyone that small acts can make ordinary places shine with hope.---The End
