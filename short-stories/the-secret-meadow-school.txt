🌼 The Secret Meadow School!

Near a European village lay a hidden meadow. Flowers bloomed, and butterflies danced. One day, Helena discovered it while chasing a kite. She called her friends Emil and Clara.

They decided to make the meadow their secret school. They brought books, pencils, and bread. They sat under a tree and studied together. Emil read stories, Clara drew pictures, and Helena wrote poems.

The teacher found them one afternoon. She smiled. “This meadow is a wonderful classroom. Nature teaches us too.”

Soon, more children joined. They learned about plants, animals, and stars. The meadow became a place of joy and discovery.

From that day, the Secret Meadow School reminded everyone that learning can happen anywhere, as long as hearts are curious and kind.---The End
