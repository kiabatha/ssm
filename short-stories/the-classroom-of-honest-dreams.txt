🌙 The Classroom of Honest Dreams!

Children in a European classroom shared their dreams. Helena dreamed of teaching. Emil dreamed of painting. Lukas dreamed of helping others.

The teacher explained, “Honest dreams guide us to kind futures.”

Soon, children began writing their dreams on paper stars. They hung them around the classroom. The room glowed with hope.

From that day, the Classroom of Honest Dreams reminded everyone that truth makes dreams strong.__The End
