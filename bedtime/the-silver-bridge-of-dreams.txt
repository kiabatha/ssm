The Silver Bridge of Dreams!

In Austria, Lukas lived near a river that shimmered under the moon. One night he saw a silver bridge rising from the water. He stepped onto it and found children from every land waiting. Together they crossed into a world where stars grew like flowers and laughter filled the air. Lukas felt safe, knowing the bridge carried kindness across the night.
