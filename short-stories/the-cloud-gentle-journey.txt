☁️ The Cloud’s Gentle Journey!

In a European countryside, children often watched the clouds drift across the sky. One cloud seemed softer and slower than the rest. A girl named Helena called it “the gentle cloud.”

One afternoon, Helena and her brother Emil lay in the meadow. They followed the cloud as it moved above the hills. Emil said, “It looks like it is on a journey.” Helena nodded. “It teaches us to move calmly.”

The cloud passed over the village, shading the farmers as they worked. It drifted across the river, cooling the children who played nearby. Wherever it went, it brought comfort.

The teacher explained, “Gentleness is a gift. The cloud shows us that even small acts can bring peace.”

From that day, the children called it the Cloud’s Gentle Journey. They learned that kindness, like a cloud, can travel far and touch many lives.---The End
