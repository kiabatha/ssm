The Kind Word Contest!

In class, the teacher announced a new contest. “Today,” she said, “we will see who can say the most kind words.”

The children were excited. They began by saying “thank you” and “well done.” Soon, they added more words: “You are brave,” “You are smart,” “You are kind.” The classroom filled with laughter and smiles.

One boy said, “I like your drawing.” Another girl said, “You play football very well.” Even the shy children joined in.

At the end of the day, the teacher said, “You are all winners. Kind words are like sunshine. They make hearts warm.”

The children agreed. They promised to keep using kind words every day, not just during contests. They learned that kindness is not about winning, but about making others feel valued.
