🪙 The Coin of Honest Sharing!

In a European town, children often played near the fountain in the square. One day, Lukas found a shiny coin on the ground. He picked it up and looked around. Clara said, “It must belong to someone.”

Instead of keeping it, Lukas placed the coin on the fountain ledge. Soon, Emil arrived and said, “That is my coin. I dropped it while buying bread.” Lukas smiled and handed it back. Emil thanked him warmly.

The teacher, who watched nearby, said, “Honest sharing makes trust strong.” The children realized that even small things could carry big lessons.

Later, they decided to create a game. Each child brought a small item to share—a ribbon, a marble, a piece of fruit. They placed them in a basket and took turns giving them away. Smiles spread across faces.

From that day, the Coin of Honest Sharing reminded everyone that honesty and kindness are treasures greater than gold._The End
