In a European village stood a bakery where bread was baked with courage. Clara said, “I will share mine.” Emil added, “I will help others.” Helena said, “I will speak kindly.”

The teacher explained, “Friendship courage feeds hearts.”

Soon, villagers visited to taste the bread of bravery. From that day, the Bakery of Friendship Courage reminded everyone that courage can be shared like food._The End
