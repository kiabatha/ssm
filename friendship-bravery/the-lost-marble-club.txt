The Lost Marble Club!

Ali and his friends loved playing with marbles. One day, Ali lost his favorite blue marble. His friends helped him search the grass, the playground, and even the sandpit. At last, they found it near the swings. Ali thanked them with a hug. He learned that true friends care about small things because they care about you.
