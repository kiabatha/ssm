The Night of the Golden Moon!

In Italy, Marco saw the moon turn golden one night. It bent low, shining across the land like a lantern. Marco walked into dreams where golden light built bridges across rivers and castles. He met children who shared laughter under the glow, and together they painted the sky with hope. When morning came, Marco woke with joy, knowing the golden moon would always guard his sleep.
