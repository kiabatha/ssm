📓 The Notebook of Gentle Wishes!

Helena kept a notebook in her European classroom. She wrote gentle wishes: “I wish my friend courage,” “I wish my teacher peace.”

Her classmates added their own wishes. Soon, the notebook was full of kind words.

The teacher explained, “Gentle wishes make hearts strong.”
From that day, the Notebook of Gentle Wishes reminded everyone that kindness begins with hope.__The End
