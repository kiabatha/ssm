The Gift of Listening!

Amir loved to talk, but one day his friend Sara looked sad. She sat quietly, staring at the ground. Amir wanted to cheer her up, but instead he remembered what his teacher had said: “Sometimes the best gift is listening.”

He sat beside Sara and said softly, “Would you like to tell me what is wrong?” Sara began to speak. She told him about her worries at school and how she felt left out during games. Amir listened carefully. He did not interrupt. He nodded and showed he cared.

When Sara finished, she smiled and said, “Thank you. I feel lighter now.” Amir realized that listening had helped more than any joke or story.

From that day, Amir tried to listen whenever his friends needed him. He learned that friendship grows stronger when you give time and attention.
