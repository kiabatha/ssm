🏮 The House of Brave Lanterns!

On a hill stood a house filled with lanterns. Each lantern carried a brave story. Clara lit one and said, “I spoke the truth.” Emil lit another, “I helped a friend.” Helena lit a third, “I faced my fear.”

The teacher explained, “Brave lanterns guide us in darkness.” Soon, villagers visited to light their own lanterns. From that day, the House of Brave Lanterns reminded everyone that courage shines._The End
