🐐 The Kid Goat’s Brave Leap!

In a European hillside lived a kid goat named Clara. Clara loved climbing rocks, but she feared leaping across gaps.

One day, the children built a small bridge of stones. Clara hesitated. A boy named Emil said, “Bravery is trying, even if you fall.” Clara took a deep breath and leapt. She landed safely. The children clapped. “Clara’s leap is brave!”

Clara realized that bravery is not about being perfect. It is about trying with hope. From that day, she leapt proudly, teaching others that courage grows with each step.---The End
