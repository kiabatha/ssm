🦢 The Goose’s Honest Path!

In the village, a goose named Clara led animals along a path. She never hid the stones or the puddles. She showed the way honestly. Emil the rabbit said, “You make the path safe.” Helena the fox added, “We trust you.”

The teacher owl explained, “An honest path may be hard, but it is always true.”

From that day, Clara’s path reminded everyone that honesty guides us home._The End
