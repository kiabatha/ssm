The Mountain Behind the Clouds!

Oscar had always wondered what was behind the tall mountain near his village. Clouds covered its peak every single day. His grandmother said no one had ever climbed it.

One summer morning, Oscar packed bread, cheese, and water in his bag. He told his grandmother he was going to explore the mountain paths. She smiled and handed him a warm scarf.

The trail started easy. Oscar walked through meadows full of wildflowers. Butterflies danced around him. The sun felt warm on his face. After an hour, the path became steeper. Rocks and roots made walking harder.

Oscar climbed higher. The air grew cooler. He put on his scarf. Soon he entered the clouds. Everything turned gray and misty. He could only see a few steps ahead.

He heard a sound like wind chimes. Following the sound, Oscar found a small clearing. In the center stood a tree unlike any he had seen before. Its leaves were silver and made music when the wind touched them.

Under the tree sat an old man with a long white beard. He wore simple clothes and smiled at Oscar. "Hello, young climber," the man said. "Not many people make it this far."

Oscar sat down to rest. The old man shared hot tea from a thermos. They talked about the village, the mountain, and the world beyond the clouds.

"Why do you live up here?" Oscar asked.

The old man laughed gently. "I came here many years ago to think clearly. The clouds help me focus. But I miss the village sometimes. Would you tell me about it?"

Oscar described everything: the market on Saturdays, the school, the festivals, and the people. The old man listened with bright eyes, asking questions and laughing at funny stories.

After a while, the old man gave Oscar a small silver leaf from the tree. "This is for you," he said. "When you shake it, it will make music. Let it remind you that adventure is not just about reaching the top. It is also about the people you meet along the way."

Oscar thanked him and began his climb back down. When he emerged from the clouds, the village looked different somehow. Smaller, but also more precious.

At home, his grandmother asked about his adventure. Oscar showed her the silver leaf and told her about the old man. She listened carefully, then hugged him tight.

"You climbed higher than you thought you could," she said. "That takes courage."

Oscar kept the silver leaf on his windowsill. Sometimes he shook it, and the music reminded him of the mountain, the clouds, and the kind old man who lived above the world._The End
