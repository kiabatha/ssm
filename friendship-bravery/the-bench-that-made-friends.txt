The Bench That Made Friends!

In the park stood an old wooden bench. Most children walked past it without noticing. One day, Ali sat on the bench alone. Soon, Sara joined him. They began to talk about their favorite games.

The next day, more children sat on the bench. They shared stories, jokes, and even snacks. The bench became a meeting place. Whenever someone felt lonely, they sat there, and soon a friend would join.

The children decided to call it “The Friendship Bench.” They painted it with bright colors and drew small hearts on the sides. The bench was no longer old. It was full of life and laughter.

Ali learned that sometimes friendship begins with a simple seat and a kind word.
