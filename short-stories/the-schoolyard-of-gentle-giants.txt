🌲 The Schoolyard of Gentle Giants!

In a European schoolyard grew tall oak trees. Children called them Gentle Giants. They played under the branches and felt safe.

One afternoon, Lukas built a bench from fallen wood. Helena said, “The giants protect us.” Emil nodded. “They are gentle, even though they are strong.”

The teacher explained, “Gentleness is true strength.”

From that day, the Schoolyard of Gentle Giants reminded everyone that kindness can be strong.__The End
