🛍️ The Market of Caring Hands!

In a European town square, children visited a market. Sellers offered food, clothes, and toys. But what made the market special were caring hands. Helena helped carry baskets. Emil shared fruit. Clara guided a lost child.

The teacher explained, “Caring hands make markets stronger than walls.” Soon, the market became a place of joy. From that day, the Market of Caring Hands reminded everyone that care is the best trade._The End
