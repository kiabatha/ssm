🐬 The Dolphin’s Brave Leap!

In a European harbor lived a playful dolphin named Luca. Luca loved leaping out of the water. His jumps were high and graceful. But one day, a storm came. A fishing boat was stuck near the rocks. The children on the shore cried, “The boat will break!”

Luca swam quickly. He leapt high, splashing water to guide the sailors away from danger. He jumped again and again, showing them the safe path. The sailors followed his leaps and reached the harbor safely. The crowd cheered. “Luca saved them with his brave leap!”

From that day, Luca’s leaps were not only playful. They were symbols of courage. He taught the children that bravery is not about strength alone. It is about using your gift to help others.
Whenever storms came, Luca leapt proudly, guiding boats to safety. His brave leap became a light of hope for the harbor.---The End
