🏮 The Teacher’s Lantern of Hope!

Madame Clara carried a lantern during evening lessons in a European school. She said, “This lantern is hope. It lights our way.”

Children listened to stories of courage under its glow. Emil whispered, “The lantern makes learning bright.”

From that day, the Teacher’s Lantern of Hope reminded everyone that hope guides learning.__The End
