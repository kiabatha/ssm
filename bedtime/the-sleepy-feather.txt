The Sleepy Feather!

In Spain, Diego found a feather that glowed softly. When he held it, the feather lifted him into dreams where birds sang lullabies and skies opened with gentle colors. Diego drifted across valleys, feeling safe in the feather’s embrace. It whispered that lightness can carry courage. When morning came, Diego woke with hope, knowing the feather would always guide him kindly.
