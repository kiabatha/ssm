🧥 The Unicorn of Kind Promises!

Children wore cloaks decorated with promises. The unicorn touched each cloak with its horn, making them glow. Helena promised to help, Emil promised to share, Clara promised to speak kindly.

The teacher explained, “Kind promises are the warmest protection.”

Soon, villagers created their own cloaks with ribbons of promises. The unicorn’s horn glowed brighter with each promise kept.

From that day, the Unicorn of Kind Promises reminded everyone that kindness is the warmest shield, and that promises are strongest when kept._The End
