The Night of the Friendly!

In Hungary, a girl named Eszter loved to chase fireflies in summer. One evening she noticed that the fireflies were not just glowing, they were forming shapes. They gathered into circles, stars, and even letters that spelled gentle words. Eszter followed them into a meadow where the fireflies danced around her like friends. They whispered that they carried dreams from child to child, sharing light across the world. Eszter lay down in the grass, watching them float above her, and soon she drifted into sleep. Her dreams were filled with glowing paths and laughter that never ended. When she woke, she felt the warmth of friendship, knowing that the fireflies would always return to remind her that light is meant to be shared.
