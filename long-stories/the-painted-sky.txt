The Painted Sky!

Noor loved sunsets. Every evening, she would sit by her window with her box of paints and brushes, watching the sky change colors. To her, the sky was never just orange or pink—it was a canvas of endless imagination. She saw streaks of purple hiding behind the clouds, flashes of green where the sun dipped low, and sometimes even hints of silver that shimmered like stars waiting to appear.

Her classmates, however, did not understand. In art class, when the teacher asked everyone to paint a sunset, Noor’s painting was filled with wild colors—rainbow streaks, glowing dots, and swirls that looked like dancing flames. The other children laughed. “Sunsets aren’t green!” one boy shouted. “Why did you put purple in the clouds?” another girl teased. Noor’s cheeks burned with embarrassment. She wanted to explain that she painted what she felt, not just what she saw, but the words stayed trapped inside her.

The school art show was coming soon, and each student had to submit one painting. Noor thought about hiding her rainbow sunset and painting something “normal” instead. She imagined blending soft oranges and pinks, just like everyone else. That way, no one would laugh. But when she tried, her hand froze. The brush refused to move. The plain colors felt lifeless to her.

That evening, Noor sat quietly at her desk, staring at her rainbow sky painting. She thought about her grandmother, who always told her, “The world needs your colors, Noor. Don’t hide them.” Her grandmother’s words echoed in her heart. Slowly, Noor decided she would show her painting exactly as it was—wild, bright, and different.

The day of the art show arrived. The school hall buzzed with excitement. Tables were lined with neat landscapes, portraits, and still-life bowls of fruit. Noor placed her painting at the end of the row, her hands trembling. She wanted to run away, but she stayed.

At first, children walked past her painting and giggled. “Too many colors,” one whispered. Noor’s stomach twisted. But then, something unexpected happened. A judge stopped in front of her painting. He leaned closer, studying the swirls and streaks. His eyes lit up. “This is fascinating,” he said. “You’ve captured the feeling of a sunset, not just the look. That takes courage.”

Other judges gathered around. They nodded, pointing at the bold strokes and unusual colors. “It’s alive,” one said. “It feels like the sky is dancing.” Noor’s classmates, who had laughed before, now stared in silence.

When the awards were announced, Noor did not win first place. But she received a special ribbon for “Most Original Expression.” As she held the ribbon, her heart swelled with pride. She realized that creative courage wasn’t about winning—it was about daring to show the world her true colors.

That evening, Noor painted another sunset. This time, she added even more colors—golden sparks, deep blues, and fiery reds. She smiled as she worked, knowing that her sky was hers alone, and that was enough.
