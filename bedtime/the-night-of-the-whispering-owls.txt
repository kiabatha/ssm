The Night of the Whispering Owls!

In the forests of Poland, a boy named Marek loved to listen to the owls. One evening he walked to the edge of the woods and heard soft whispers above. The owls were not hooting, they were speaking in gentle voices. They told him stories of the forest, of rivers that remembered every child who played near them, and of trees that held secrets in their rings. Marek sat on a log, listening with wide eyes. The owls promised to guard his dreams and guide him with wisdom. That night, when Marek lay in bed, he felt the whispers still around him.

His dreams were filled with tall trees, glowing rivers, and owls flying like guardians of the night. He woke with peace, knowing that the forest was his friend.
