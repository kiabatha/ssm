🐭 the mouse’s brave cheese hunt!

In a European farmhouse lived a small mouse named Clara. Clara was tiny, but she was brave. She loved cheese, but the cellar where the cheese was kept was dark and full of obstacles.

One day, the children challenged her. “Clara, can you bring us a piece of cheese?” Clara nodded. She entered the cellar. Shadows moved, and the floor creaked. She felt afraid, but she whispered, “I must be brave.”

Step by step, she crossed the cellar. She climbed over barrels, squeezed through cracks, and reached the cheese. She carried a piece back to the children. They clapped. “Clara, you are brave!”

Clara realized that bravery is not about size. It is about facing fear with courage. From that day, she became known as the mouse of the brave cheese hunt. Her story reminded everyone that even the smallest heart can be strong.---The End
