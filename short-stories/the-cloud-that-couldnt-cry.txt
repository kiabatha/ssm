Lulu was a small cloud who had never made rain.
She floated above fields and forests, watching bigger clouds cry and water the earth. Lulu tried to cry, but nothing came out.
One day, she saw a thirsty flower wilting below. Lulu felt something stir inside her. She thought about the flower’s roots, the dry soil, and the bees waiting for nectar.
A single drop fell. Then another. Soon, Lulu was raining gently over the field. The flower lifted its head. Lulu had found her gift—not just rain, but care.
