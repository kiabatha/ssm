The Blanket of Dreams!

In a quiet village in France, a girl named Sophie had a blanket sewn by her grandmother. Each square of the blanket held a secret picture stitched with care. One square showed a ship sailing across the sea, another showed a garden full of roses, and another showed a castle with tall towers. At night Sophie pulled the blanket close, and the pictures began to glow. She felt herself drifting into the worlds inside the stitches.

She sailed across the sea with brave sailors, she walked through the rose garden with gentle bees, and she climbed the castle towers to wave at the stars. The blanket carried her through dreams that were kind and full of wonder. When morning came, Sophie folded the blanket neatly, knowing that every night it would open new doors for her heart.
