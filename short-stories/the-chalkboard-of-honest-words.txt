🖍️ The Chalkboard of Honest Words!

In a European classroom stood a large chalkboard. The teacher asked children to write one honest word each day. Clara wrote “truth.” Emil wrote “care.” Helena wrote “friendship.”

The chalkboard filled with words that shone like stars. The teacher explained, “Honest words guide us like light.”

From that day, the Chalkboard of Honest Words became a symbol of trust and respect.__The End
