🏞️ The Hill of Kind Lanterns!

In a European village stood a grassy hill. Children often climbed it to watch sunsets. One autumn, Helena brought lanterns. She placed them along the path.

Her friends Emil and Lukas helped. Together they lit the lanterns. The hill glowed warmly. Villagers saw the lights and joined. They carried more lanterns, each symbolizing kindness.

The teacher explained, “Lanterns shine brighter when shared. Kindness is the same.”

From that day, the Hill of Kind Lanterns became a place of joy. Children learned that kindness lights the way, even in darkness. __The End
