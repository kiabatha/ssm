The Moon’s Gentle Hug!

Clara lived in a quiet town in Italy where the moon seemed to follow her. One night, when she felt lonely, the moon bent low and wrapped her in a silver hug. She dreamed of walking across bridges of light, meeting children from every land, and sharing laughter under the stars. When she woke, Clara knew the moon’s hug was real, because her heart felt full and brave.
