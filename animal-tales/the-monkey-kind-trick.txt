🐒 The Monkey’s Kind Trick!

In a lively European town near the forest, there lived a playful monkey named Marco. Marco loved climbing trees and swinging from branches, but most of all, he loved making people laugh. Sometimes he played small tricks, like hiding apples or jumping out to surprise children. His tricks were never mean. They were always gentle and kind.

One summer day, the villagers prepared for a fair. Everyone was busy, but the baker, Mr. Henri, looked worried. His cart of bread had broken, and he could not carry his loaves to the square. Marco saw this and thought, “I must help.” He climbed down and whispered to the children, “Let us play a trick that will bring joy.”

Marco gathered the children. They carried baskets of bread while Marco danced and juggled apples to distract the crowd. People laughed and clapped, not noticing the children delivering the bread. When Mr. Henri arrived, his cart was already full in the square. He smiled with relief. “Marco, your trick was kind. You saved the fair.”

From that day, Marco became known not only as playful but also as kind. He learned that tricks can be more than fun. They can be gifts of help and joy.---The End
