🚪 The School Gate of Friendship!

At the gate of a European school, children greeted each other each morning. Clara said, “Friendship begins here.” Emil nodded.

Soon, children began helping each other at the gate. They carried bags, shared smiles, and welcomed new students.

The teacher explained, “Friendship is the best way to enter learning.”

From that day, the School Gate of Friendship reminded everyone that friendship opens doors.__The End
