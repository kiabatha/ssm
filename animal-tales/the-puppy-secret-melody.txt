🐕 The Puppy’s Secret Melody!

In a small European town lived a puppy named Oliver. Oliver was playful and cheerful, but he had a secret. He loved music. Whenever the church bells rang, he tilted his head and barked softly in rhythm. His bark sounded like a melody.

One day, a girl named Clara heard him. She said, “Oliver, you have a song inside you.” Oliver wagged his tail. Clara brought her violin and played a gentle tune. Oliver barked along, and together they made music. The villagers gathered, smiling at the unusual duet.

At the spring festival, Clara asked Oliver to perform. He stood nervously, but when the violin began, he barked in rhythm. The crowd clapped and laughed with joy. The mayor said, “This puppy’s melody is a gift.”

Oliver realized that his secret was not something to hide. It was something to share. From that day, he sang his melody whenever music played, reminding the town that joy can come from unexpected places.---The End
