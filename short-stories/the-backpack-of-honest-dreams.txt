🎒 The Backpack of Honest Dreams!

In a European school, Lukas carried a backpack filled with books and pencils. One day, he placed a small notebook inside where he wrote his honest dreams. “I want to be kind,” he wrote. “I want to help others.”

Clara saw the notebook and added her dream: “I want to teach children.” Soon, other classmates wrote their dreams too.

The teacher explained, “Honest dreams guide us like stars.”

From that day, the Backpack of Honest Dreams reminded everyone that truth makes dreams strong.__The End
