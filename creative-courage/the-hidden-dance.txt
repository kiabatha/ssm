The Hidden Dance!

Maya loved dancing, but only in her room. She invented moves that didn’t look like ballet or hip-hop—they were just hers. When her school announced a talent day, she wanted to dance, but fear held her back.

Her best friend encouraged her. “Show them your dance. It’s special.”

On the day, Maya stepped onto the stage. At first, she copied the usual steps. But then the music swelled, and she let go. She spun, leapt, and moved freely. The audience gasped, then clapped in rhythm.

Maya realized creative courage meant trusting the dance inside you, even if it’s different.
