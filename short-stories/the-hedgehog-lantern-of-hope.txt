🕯️ The Hedgehog’s Lantern of Hope!

In the forest, a hedgehog named Clara carried a lantern. She lit it when nights grew dark. Emil the fox followed the light, Helena the rabbit walked safely.

The hedgehog said, “Hope is a lantern that guides us.”
The teacher owl explained, “A lantern of hope shines even in shadows.”

From that day, Clara’s lantern reminded everyone that hope is the brightest light._The End
