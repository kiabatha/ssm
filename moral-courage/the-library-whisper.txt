The Library Whisper!

The school library was one of Bilal’s favorite places. He loved the smell of old books and the quiet rustle of pages turning. It was a place where stories lived, waiting to be discovered. But not everyone treated it that way.

One afternoon, Bilal sat at a table reading about explorers. His friends came in, laughing loudly and chasing each other between the shelves. The librarian frowned, but she was busy helping another student. Bilal’s stomach twisted. He wanted to join his friends, but he also knew the library wasn’t meant for noise.

He took a deep breath and whispered, “Guys, please be quiet. This is the library.” His friends stopped, surprised. “Don’t be boring,” one teased. Bilal’s cheeks burned, but he stood firm. “We can play outside. Here, people are trying to read.”

The librarian overheard and smiled. His friends rolled their eyes but lowered their voices. Later, one of them admitted, “You were right. I didn’t realize how loud we were.”

Bilal learned that moral courage meant speaking up for respect, even when it makes you stand out.
