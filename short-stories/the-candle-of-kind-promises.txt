🕯️ The Candle of Kind Promises!

In a European town, children lit a candle during a festival. Each made a promise: “I will help,” “I will share.”

The teacher explained, “Promises shine like candles.”

From that day, the Candle of Kind Promises reminded everyone that kindness glows when promises are kept._The End
