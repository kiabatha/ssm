🌳 Forest School House!

In the middle of a European forest stood a small wooden school house. The school was built by villagers long ago. Children walked through the trees each morning to learn inside.

One autumn, the teacher, Madame Clara, asked the children to listen carefully. “The forest is our classroom too,” she said. She led them outside. Birds sang above, and squirrels ran across branches. Clara explained, “Every sound is a lesson. The forest teaches us patience and care.”

The children gathered leaves and counted them. They measured the height of trees. They wrote poems about the wind. A boy named Lukas said, “The forest makes learning joyful.”

One day, a storm broke branches near the school house. The children worked together to clear the path. They sang while they carried sticks. Clara smiled. “You have learned the most important lesson. Helping each other makes the forest strong.”

From that day, the Forest School House became more than a building. It was a place where children learned kindness, courage, and friendship.---The End
