The Lantern of Friendship!

During a festival, the children made paper lanterns. Each lantern had a candle inside. When lit, they shone brightly.

Ali made a lantern but his candle went out. He felt sad. His friend Sara placed her lantern beside his and said, “Friendship is like light. When one fades, another shines to help.”

Soon, all the children placed their lanterns together. The glow filled the street with warmth. Neighbors came out to watch. The teacher said, “This lantern of friendship shows that when we stand together, darkness disappears.”

Ali smiled. He learned that friendship is not about one light, but about many lights shining together.
