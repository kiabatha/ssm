The Garden of Music!

Sofia loved her garden. She planted flowers, but she wanted something more—something magical. She tied little bells and wind chimes to sticks, placing them among the plants. When the wind blew, the garden sang.

Her neighbors thought it was strange. “Gardens are for flowers, not music,” they said. Sofia felt embarrassed. Maybe she should take them down.

But one evening, as the sun set, the wind picked up. The chimes tinkled softly, blending with the rustle of leaves. A neighbor stopped, listening. “It sounds beautiful,” she whispered. Soon, more neighbors gathered, smiling at the gentle music.

Sofia realized creative courage meant daring to make beauty in your own way.
