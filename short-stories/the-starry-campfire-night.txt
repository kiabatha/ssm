🔥 The Starry Campfire Night!

In a European forest, children gathered for a campfire night. Their teacher, Madame Clara, lit the fire carefully. Sparks rose into the sky, joining the stars.

The children sat in a circle. Lukas played the flute, and Helena told a story about brave heroes. Emil roasted bread on sticks. The fire glowed warmly, and the stars shone above.

Clara said, “The fire teaches us courage. The stars teach us hope.” The children listened quietly. They felt safe and joyful.

Later, they sang together. Their voices echoed through the forest. The mayor, who joined them, said, “This campfire night reminds us that friendship is the brightest light.”

From that day, the Starry Campfire Night became a tradition. Children learned that courage and hope grow stronger when shared.---The End
