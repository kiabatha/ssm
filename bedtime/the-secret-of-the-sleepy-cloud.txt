The Secret of the Sleepy Cloud!

In the hills of Scotland, Isla watched a cloud drift lower than the rest. It looked sleepy, as if it wanted to rest near her window. Isla reached out and touched it, and the cloud whispered a secret. It said that every child who believes in kindness can shape dreams into colors. The cloud carried Isla across the sky, showing her rivers that sparkled like silver ribbons and forests that glowed with gentle light. She felt safe inside the cloud’s soft embrace. When she returned to her bed, the cloud promised to visit again whenever she needed courage. Isla closed her eyes, knowing that even the smallest cloud could carry the biggest dreams.
