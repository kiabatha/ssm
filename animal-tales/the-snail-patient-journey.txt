🐌 The Snail’s Patient Journey!

In a European garden lived a snail named Clara. Clara moved slowly, carrying her shell. Other animals laughed kindly. “You will never reach the gate,” they said. Clara whispered, “Patience is my strength.”

One spring, the children placed a race track in the garden. Clara joined. She moved slowly, step by step. The rabbit rushed ahead but grew tired. Clara kept moving patiently. At last, she reached the finish line. The children clapped. “Clara’s journey is patient and true.”

Clara realized that patience is not weakness. It is steady strength. From that day, she walked proudly, teaching others that slow steps can still reach dreams.---The End
