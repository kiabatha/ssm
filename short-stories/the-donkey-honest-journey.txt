🐴 The Donkey’s Honest Journey!

In a village, a donkey named Matteo carried baskets of fruit to the market. He never took shortcuts or hid broken fruit. He always told the truth. Clara the baker asked, “Is this fruit fresh?” Matteo answered honestly, “Some are sweet, some are not.”

The villagers trusted him because he spoke with honesty. On his journey home, Matteo helped a child carry water. He explained, “Honesty is like a strong bridge. It never breaks.”

The teacher owl said, “An honest journey is longer, but it is always safe.”
From that day, Matteo’s journey reminded everyone that truth is the best companion._The End
