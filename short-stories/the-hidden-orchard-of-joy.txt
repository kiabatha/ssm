🍊 The Hidden Orchard of Joy!

Behind a stone wall in a European village lay a hidden orchard. Trees grew heavy with fruit, but few people knew about it.

One day, Emil chased a ball and found the orchard gate. He called Clara and Helena. Together they entered and saw apples, pears, and plums shining in the sun. Clara said, “This orchard feels joyful.”

The children picked fruit and shared it with villagers. Smiles spread across faces. The mayor said, “This orchard teaches us that joy grows when we share.”

Soon, the orchard became a gathering place. Families visited, children played, and laughter filled the air.

From that day, the Hidden Orchard of Joy reminded everyone that happiness is sweetest when shared.---The End
