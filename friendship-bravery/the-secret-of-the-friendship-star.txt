The Secret of the Friendship Star!

Late one evening, the children gathered outside to watch the stars. Suddenly, one star seemed to shine brighter than the rest. Sara pointed and said, “That is the Friendship Star.”

The children decided to make a wish. Each wished for something kind. One wished for courage to help others. Another wished for honesty. Another wished for joy to share with friends.

The star twinkled as if it had heard them. The children felt connected, even though they were different in many ways.

The teacher said, “This star reminds us that friendship is like light. It shines brightest when we share kindness.”

The children went home with warm hearts. They learned that friendship is not only on earth, but also written in the stars.
