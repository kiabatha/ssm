🌳 The Park of Friendship Songs!

Children visited a park where songs of friendship were sung. Clara sang softly, Emil played the flute, Helena clapped.

The teacher explained, “Friendship songs are stronger than walls.”

Soon, villagers joined. The park echoed with joy. From that day, the Park of Friendship Songs reminded everyone that friendship can be heard in music._The End
