🖤 The Blackboard of Courage!

In a European classroom stood a blackboard. The teacher asked children to write brave actions. Emil wrote, “I spoke the truth.” Clara wrote, “I helped a stranger.”

The blackboard filled with words of courage. The teacher explained, “Courage grows when shared.”

From that day, the Blackboard of Courage reminded everyone that bravery can be written and remembered.__The End
