🌳 The Park of Caring Stars1

Children visited a park decorated with lanterns shaped like stars. Clara said, “Each star is a caring act.” Emil added, “They shine when we help.”

The teacher explained, “Caring stars guide us like light.”

Soon, villagers joined. They added their own stars.

From that day, the Park of Caring Stars reminded everyone that care shines like starlight._The End
