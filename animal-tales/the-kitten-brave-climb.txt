🐈 The Kitten’s Brave Climb!

In a European village lived a kitten named Sofia. Sofia was small and shy, but she dreamed of climbing the tallest oak tree in the square. Other cats laughed kindly. “You are too small,” they said. But Sofia whispered, “I will try.”

One morning, she placed her paws on the trunk and began to climb. Step by step, she moved upward. The children watched, cheering. Halfway up, Sofia slipped. She felt afraid, but she remembered her dream. She held tightly and continued.

At last, she reached the top. She looked out over the rooftops and saw the whole village. The children clapped loudly. “Sofia is brave!” they shouted.

Sofia realized that bravery is not about size. It is about trying even when fear appears. From that day, she climbed proudly, teaching others that courage grows with each step.---The End
