The Lunch Share!

Emma opened her lunchbox and saw her favorite sandwich. She was about to take a bite when she noticed a classmate sitting quietly with no food. His stomach growled, and he looked down, embarrassed.

Emma hesitated. If she shared, she would have less for herself. Her friends shrugged. “It’s not your problem,” they said. But Emma thought about how hungry she would feel in his place.
She slid half of her sandwich onto a napkin and handed it to him. His eyes widened. “Thank you,” he whispered. They ate together, smiling.

Later, the teacher noticed and praised Emma for her kindness. Emma realized moral courage meant giving up something to help someone else.
