🪵 The Riverbank of Friendship!

In a European village flowed a wide river. Children often played by its bank. One summer, Clara and Emil built a small wooden raft. They invited their friends to join.

Together, they floated near the shore. They laughed, sang, and shared bread. Clara said, “The river carries our friendship.” Emil nodded. “It makes us stronger.”

The teacher explained, “Friendship is like a river. It flows when we care for each other.”

Soon, the villagers gathered at the riverbank. They held picnics and games. The river became a place of joy.

From that day, the Riverbank of Friendship reminded everyone that kindness flows like water, bringing peace to all.---The End
