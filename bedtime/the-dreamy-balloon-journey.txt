The Dreamy Balloon Journey!

In Spain, a boy named Mateo found a basket tied to a cluster of balloons. The balloons glowed softly as if they carried pieces of the sky. When Mateo stepped inside, the basket lifted gently, rising above the rooftops. He floated past towers, rivers, and gardens, each glowing under the moon. The balloons carried him higher until he reached a land where children painted stars with brushes of light. Mateo joined them, painting his own star that shone with kindness. The balloons whispered that every dream is a journey, and every child has the power to rise above fear. When morning came, Mateo woke in his bed, but he still felt the gentle pull of the balloons, reminding him that dreams can lift hearts higher than mountains.
