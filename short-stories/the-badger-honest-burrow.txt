🦡 The Badger’s Honest Burrow!

A badger named Lukas built a burrow. He showed every corner honestly. Clara the hedgehog asked, “Why do you not hide the cracks?” Lukas replied, “Honesty makes burrows safe.”

Emil the fox said, “We trust you.”

The teacher owl explained, “An honest burrow is stronger than stone.”

From that day, Lukas’s burrow reminded everyone that honesty builds homes._The End
