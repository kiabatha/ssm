The Boy Who Painted Weather!

Lukas had a special gift, but he did not know it yet. He loved to paint. Every afternoon after school, he sat in his room and painted whatever he imagined.

One day, he painted a picture of rain falling on his garden. That evening, it rained, even though the forecast said it would be sunny. His mother was surprised but did not think much about it.

The next day, Lukas painted sunshine and flowers. When he woke up the following morning, the sun blazed bright and new flowers bloomed in the garden overnight. His father was confused but happy.

Lukas started to suspect something. He painted a picture of snow falling gently. The next day, it snowed in the middle of summer. The whole town talked about the strange weather.

That night, an old woman knocked on his door. She introduced herself as Agneta, a weather keeper. "I know what you can do," she said. "You are a weather painter. It is a rare gift."

"What does that mean?" Lukas asked.

"Your paintings change the weather," Agneta explained. "But you must be careful. Weather affects many people. You must paint responsibly."

She taught Lukas how to control his gift. He learned that painting gentle rain helped gardens grow. Painting sunshine made people happy. Painting snow created beauty but also made travel difficult.

"Think about what people need, not just what you want," Agneta said.

Lukas took her advice seriously. When farmers needed rain, he painted soft storms. When children wanted to play outside, he painted clear skies. When the town needed a special day, he painted rainbows.

But one day, Lukas got angry at his sister for breaking his favorite paintbrush. Without thinking, he painted a fierce thunderstorm. That night, lightning struck a tree near their house. His sister was scared.

Lukas felt terrible. He realized his gift was powerful and could hurt people if he was not careful. He apologized to his sister and painted calm weather for a week.

Agneta visited again. "You learned an important lesson," she said. "Power must be used wisely. Anger makes us want to lash out, but we must control ourselves."

From then on, Lukas painted thoughtfully. He kept a journal where he wrote down why he painted each weather picture. He wanted to make sure he was helping, not hurting.

Years later, Lukas became the official weather painter for his whole region. He worked with farmers, travelers, and event planners to create weather that helped everyone. He never forgot that with great power comes great responsibility._The End
