🦉 The Owl’s Wise Gift!

In a European forest lived a wise owl named Viktor. Viktor spent his nights watching the stars and his days teaching animals lessons. He believed that wisdom was a gift meant to be shared.

One winter, the children of the village struggled with their lessons. They felt tired and confused. Viktor flew to the school window and said, “I will give you a gift of wisdom.” He brought small feathers, each with a word written on it: courage, kindness, patience, and honesty.

The teacher, Mrs. Clara, placed the feathers on the table. She explained, “These are not magic, but reminders. If you carry courage, kindness, patience, and honesty, you will succeed.”

The children listened carefully. They began to study with patience, help each other with kindness, and face challenges with courage. Soon, their lessons became easier. They realized that wisdom is not about knowing everything. It is about living with good values.

Viktor watched proudly. His gift was simple, but it changed the children’s hearts. From that day, whenever they faced a problem, they remembered the owl’s wise gift.---The End
