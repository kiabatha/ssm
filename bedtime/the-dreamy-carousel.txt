The Dreamy Carousel!

In France, Elise visited a carousel that only turned at night. Its horses glowed with golden light, and its music carried her into dreams. She rode through skies filled with stars, meeting children who laughed as they spun together. The carousel whispered that joy is meant to be shared. Elise woke with peace, knowing that every night the carousel would return to carry her gently into sleep.
