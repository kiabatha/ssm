🌟 The Unicorn of Caring Hearts!

Children decorated a park with hearts. Clara said, “Each heart is care.” Emil wrote caring words on paper hearts. Helena gave them to friends. The unicorn touched each heart, making them glow brighter.

The teacher explained, “Caring hearts are the strongest strength.”

Soon, villagers joined. The park glowed with hearts, and the unicorn’s horn shone like the sun._The End
