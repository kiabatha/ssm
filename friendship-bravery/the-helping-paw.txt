The Helping Paw!

Sara found a stray puppy near her school. The puppy looked hungry and weak. She gave it some food and water. The puppy wagged its tail and followed her.

Her friends joined in. One brought a blanket, another gave biscuits, and another built a small shelter. Together, they cared for the puppy.

The teacher said, “This puppy is lucky to have your helping paws. But you are lucky too, because kindness makes you strong.”

The children learned that helping even the smallest creature brings joy and friendship.
