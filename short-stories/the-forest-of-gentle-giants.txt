🌲 The Forest of Gentle Giants!

In a European valley stood tall oak trees. The villagers called them Gentle Giants. Their branches stretched wide, and their trunks were strong.

Children often played under the trees. One summer, Emil and Clara built a small bench from fallen wood. They sat quietly, listening to the wind. Emil said, “The giants protect us.” Clara nodded. “They are gentle, even though they are strong.”

The teacher explained, “Gentleness is true strength. The trees teach us patience and care.”

Soon, the villagers held gatherings under the oaks. They sang songs, shared food, and told stories. The forest became a place of peace.

From that day, the Forest of Gentle Giants reminded everyone that strength and kindness can live together.---The End
