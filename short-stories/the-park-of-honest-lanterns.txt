🌳 The Park of Honest Lanterns!

Children visited a park decorated with lanterns. Clara said, “Each lantern is a truth.” Emil added, “They glow when spoken honestly.”

The teacher explained, “Honest lanterns guide us like stars.”

Soon, villagers joined. The park became bright with honesty. From that day, the Park of Honest Lanterns reminded everyone that truth shines like light._The End
