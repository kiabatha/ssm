The tryouts for the school's basketball team were today, and everyone was excited. Everyone except for Alex. He watched from the sidelines as the other kids dribbled and shot with ease. His own legs, which were helped by special braces, felt clumsy and slow.

“Come on, Alex, you can do it!” his friend Jake called from the court.

But when Alex tried to run, he stumbled. 
A few kids snickered. His face burned with shame. He turned to leave, convinced he didn't belong.

Jake saw him leaving. He remembered how Alex was the best strategist he knew; he could remember every player's position and think three moves ahead. Without a second thought, Jake blew the whistle he was holding.

“Coach!” he said, his voice loud and clear. “A team needs more than just fast runners. It needs a smart mind. Alex is the smartest person I know. He should be our team strategist.”

The coach looked thoughtful. The other kids stopped and listened. Jake walked over to Alex. “We need you, Alex. Not your legs, but your brain. A real team needs everyone’s strengths.”

Touched by his friend’s words, Alex agreed. From that day on, he sat with the coach, drawing plays and helping the team see the game in a new way. They started winning more games, not because they were faster, but because they were smarter. They became the team that almost wasn't—the team that learned that true strength comes from including everyone.
