🦜 The Parrot’s Honest Song!

In a European port town lived a bright parrot named Hugo. Hugo had feathers of green, yellow, and red. He loved to sing, but unlike other parrots, he did not copy words. He sang only what was true.

One day, the villagers prepared for a market. A merchant tried to trick the children by selling broken toys. Hugo flew above and sang loudly, “The toys are broken! The toys are broken!” The children stopped and looked. The merchant felt ashamed. He repaired the toys and promised to be honest.

The mayor said, “Hugo’s song is honest. It protects us.” From that day, Hugo sang whenever someone needed truth. He reminded the town that honesty is a melody that keeps hearts safe.

Children loved him. They said, “Hugo’s song teaches us to speak the truth kindly.” Hugo realized that his gift was not only his voice. It was his honesty.---The End
