The Smile Collector!

Fatima loved collecting things. One day, she decided to collect smiles. She walked around the playground, telling jokes, sharing snacks, and helping friends. Each time someone smiled, she counted it.

By the end of the day, she had collected twenty smiles. She told her teacher, who said, “Smiles are the best collection. They never fade, and they make others happy too.”

Fatima realized that her collection was special. She promised to keep collecting smiles every day.

The children learned that kindness spreads like a smile. When you give one, you receive many more.
