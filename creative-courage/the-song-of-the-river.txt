The Song of the River!

Aisha lived near a wide, flowing river. She loved listening to its sounds—the rush of water, the splash of fish, the whisper of reeds. One day, she wrote a poem about the river. It was simple, filled with words like “silver,” “dance,” and “song.”

Her school announced a poetry reading. Aisha’s classmates prepared long, complicated verses. Aisha felt her poem was too small, too plain. She almost decided not to read it.

The night before, she sat by the river, reading her poem aloud to the water. The river seemed to answer with its gentle flow. She smiled. Maybe her poem wasn’t big, but it was true.

At the reading, her voice shook as she began. “The river sings / silver songs / dancing with the sky.” The room grew quiet. When she finished, there was a pause—and then applause.

Her teacher said, “Your words are simple, but they carry music.” Aisha realized creative courage meant trusting her own voice, even if it was small.
