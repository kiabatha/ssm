The Lost Bracelet!

Hana was walking through the schoolyard when she spotted something shiny under the swing set. She bent down and picked up a delicate bracelet with tiny silver charms. It looked expensive. Her first thought was excitement—she could keep it. No one had seen her pick it up.

But then she noticed one of the charms: a small heart with the initials “MR.” engraved on it. Suddenly, the bracelet felt heavier. This wasn’t just jewelry; it belonged to someone. Hana imagined how sad she would feel if she lost something special.

Her friends told her, “Just keep it. No one will know.” Hana hesitated. She wanted to fit in, but her heart whispered that it wasn’t right.

At recess, she walked to the teacher’s desk and placed the bracelet down. “I found this,” she said quietly. The teacher smiled warmly. Later that day, a girl named Mariam came running in, tears on her face. “My bracelet! Thank you!” she cried, hugging Hana.

Hana realized moral courage meant doing the right thing, even when others told her not to.
