🌿 The Badger’s Gentle Path!

A badger named Lukas cleared a path in the forest. He moved stones and branches so friends could walk safely. Clara the hedgehog said, “Your path is gentle.” Emil the fox added, “It makes us calm.”

The teacher owl explained, “A gentle path is stronger than speed.”

From that day, Lukas’s path reminded everyone that gentleness builds safe journeys._The End
