🏪 The Shop of Gentle Smiles!

In a European town stood a shop where smiles were given freely. Clara greeted everyone with joy. Emil shared laughter. Helena offered gentle words.

The teacher explained, “Gentle smiles are treasures greater than gold.”

Soon, villagers visited the shop daily. From that day, the Shop of Gentle Smiles reminded everyone that kindness can be sold without price._The End
