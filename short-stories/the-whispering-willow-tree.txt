🌳 The Whispering Willow Tree!

In a European park grew a tall willow tree. Its branches bent low, and the wind made them whisper. Children often played nearby, but they never listened closely.

One afternoon, a girl named Clara sat under the tree. She heard the branches whisper softly. She told her friend Emil, “The willow speaks.” Emil laughed, but when he sat beside her, he heard it too.

The whispers sounded like gentle advice. “Be kind. Be patient. Be brave.” The children shared this with their teacher. She said, “The tree reminds us of lessons we must carry in our hearts.”

Soon, more children came to listen. They sat quietly, hearing the willow’s gentle voice. The park became a place of peace. Clara realized that wisdom can come from nature if we listen carefully.

From that day, the Whispering Willow Tree became a friend to all who sought hope.---The End
