🐾 The Ferret’s Caring Hug!

In the meadow, a ferret named Emil hugged his friends. He hugged softly so no one felt hurt. Clara the rabbit said, “Your hug shows care.” Helena the fox added, “It warms us.”

The teacher owl explained, “A caring hug is stronger than walls.”

From that day, Emil’s hug reminded everyone that care can be shown in gentle arms._The End
