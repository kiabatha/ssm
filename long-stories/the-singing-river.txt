The Singing River!

Felix lived beside a river that did not behave like other rivers. At night, when the moon was bright, the river sang. The water itself made melodies that floated through the air.

Most people thought the singing was wind or birds. But Felix knew better. He sat by the river every night and listened carefully. The songs told stories about ancient forests, distant mountains, and forgotten kingdoms.

One night, the river sang a sad song. Felix asked, "Why are you sad?"

To his shock, the river answered. Its voice sounded like water over stones. "I am forgetting," the river said. "Rivers remember everything that happens along their banks. But I am old. My memories are fading."

"How can I help?" Felix asked.

"Tell me stories," the river said. "When you tell me about the present, it helps me hold onto the past."

So Felix began visiting the river every night. He told stories about his school, his family, his town. He described festivals, arguments, celebrations, and ordinary days. The river listened and sang brighter songs.

Other children noticed Felix talking to the river. At first, they laughed at him. But then they heard the songs too. Slowly, they joined him.

Each child told their own stories. The river collected them all, weaving them into beautiful melodies. The songs became richer and more complex.

An old man in the village heard about the singing river. He came to listen one night. Tears ran down his face. "I heard this song when I was a boy," he said. "I thought I had imagined it."

"What does it mean?" Felix asked.

"It is the song of my grandfather's wedding," the old man said. "The river remembers it even though I had forgotten."
More people came to the river after that. They heard songs about their ancestors, about important moments in the town's history, about births and deaths and everything in between.

Felix realized the river was a living library. It kept the town's memory alive through music. As long as people came to listen and share stories, the river would never forget.

The town decided to protect the river. They stopped polluting it. They planted trees along its banks. They treated it with respect.

Years later, Felix became a teacher. He brought his students to the river and taught them to listen. "This river holds our history," he said. "If we forget to listen, we lose part of ourselves."

The river sang on, night after night, keeping memories safe in its flowing water. And the people remembered to be grateful for the gift of its songs._The End
