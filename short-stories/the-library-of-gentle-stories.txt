📖 The Library of Gentle Stories!

In a European town stood a library filled with old books. Clara and Emil loved to visit. They discovered stories about kindness, patience, and hope.

One afternoon, Helena read aloud a tale about a boy who shared bread with strangers. The children listened quietly. Emil said, “Gentle stories teach us gentle hearts.”

Soon, the library became a gathering place. Children read together and shared lessons.

From that day, the Library of Gentle Stories reminded everyone that kindness can be found in words.__The End
