🎶 The Teacher’s Gentle Song!

Madame Clara sang softly in her European classroom. Her song carried words of hope and care. Children listened quietly. Emil whispered, “Her song makes learning peaceful.”

Soon, children began singing together. The classroom filled with gentle voices.

The teacher explained, “Gentle songs teach gentle hearts.”

From that day, the Teacher’s Gentle Song reminded everyone that music can carry kindness.__The End
