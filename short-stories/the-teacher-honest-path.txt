🛤️ the teacher’s honest path!

Madame Clara often walked with her students through the school garden. She said, “This path is honest. It shows us where we are going.”

Children shared their own truths as they walked. Lukas admitted he once forgot homework but promised to do better. Helena said she helped her neighbor. Emil spoke about standing up for a friend.

Clara explained, “Honesty is the strongest step.”
From that day, the Teacher’s Honest Path reminded everyone that truth guides learning.__The End
