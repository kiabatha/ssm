🐇 The Bunny’s Kind Lantern!

In a European forest lived a bunny named Clara. Clara loved making lanterns from leaves and flowers. She placed them along paths to guide travelers.

One autumn, the nights grew dark. The children feared walking home. Clara lit her lanterns and placed them on the trail. The children followed the glowing path safely. They clapped. “Clara’s lantern is kind!”

The elder said, “Her light shows that kindness guides us.” Clara realized that her lanterns were more than decorations. They were gifts of care. From that day, she lit paths proudly, teaching others that kindness shines in small acts.---The End
