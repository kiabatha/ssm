The Clockmaker's Apprentice!

Marta loved watching her neighbor, Mr. Bergman, repair clocks in his tiny shop. Gears, springs, and tiny screws covered his workbench. Every clock in the shop ticked at a different rhythm.

One afternoon, Mr. Bergman asked Marta if she wanted to learn clockmaking. Her eyes went wide. "Yes!" she said.
Her first job was organizing screws by size. It seemed boring at first, but Mr. Bergman explained that every tiny part mattered. One wrong screw could stop a whole clock.

After a week, Mr. Bergman let Marta help with a broken pocket watch. He showed her how to open the back carefully. Inside were dozens of golden gears, frozen in place.

"What is wrong with it?" Marta asked.

"We must look closely," Mr. Bergman said. "Sometimes the problem is very small."

They examined each gear with a magnifying glass. Finally, Marta spotted it: a bent spring, no bigger than her fingernail. Mr. Bergman smiled. "Good eyes," he said.

He showed her how to remove the spring carefully and reshape it with special tools. Marta's hands shook a little, but she did exactly as he showed her. When they put the spring back and wound the watch, it began to tick.

Marta felt proud. She had helped fix something that seemed impossible.

Weeks passed. Marta learned more every day. She learned that patience was more important than speed. She learned that some problems took hours to find. She learned that finishing a repair felt wonderful.

One day, a woman brought in a clock that had belonged to her grandfather. It had not worked in twenty years. She said it was too special to throw away.

Mr. Bergman studied it, then looked at Marta. "Would you like to try?" he asked.

Marta felt nervous but excited. She carefully opened the clock and found the problem: dried oil had glued the gears together. She cleaned each piece with special solution, oiled them properly, and put everything back.

When she wound the key, the clock began to tick. Then it chimed the hour with beautiful clear notes. The woman cried happy tears and hugged Marta.

That night, Marta realized something important. Fixing clocks was not just about gears and springs. It was about bringing broken things back to life. It was about helping people keep their memories safe.

She kept learning from Mr. Bergman for years. Eventually, she became a master clockmaker herself. But she never forgot that first pocket watch, or the lesson that small things matter most._The End
