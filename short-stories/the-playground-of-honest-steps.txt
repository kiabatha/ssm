🛝 The Playground of Honest Steps!

Children played in a European school playground. Helena noticed that some children cheated in games. She said, “Let us play with honest steps.”

Soon, children began playing fairly. They laughed more and trusted each other.

The teacher explained, “Honesty makes games joyful.”

From that day, the Playground of Honest Steps reminded everyone that truth builds fun.__The End
