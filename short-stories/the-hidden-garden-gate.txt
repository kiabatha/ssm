🌸 The Hidden Garden Gate!

Behind an old stone wall in a European town stood a hidden gate. Few people noticed it. One day, a boy named Adrian found the gate while chasing a butterfly. He pushed gently, and it opened.

Inside was a secret garden. Flowers of every color bloomed. Bees hummed, and birds sang. Adrian called his friends Sofia and Clara. Together they explored the garden.

They discovered a fountain covered in ivy. They found benches carved from wood. The garden felt magical. Sofia said, “This place is a gift. We must care for it.”

The children cleaned the paths and watered the flowers. They invited the teacher to see. She smiled. “You have found a hidden treasure. The garden teaches us to protect beauty.”

Soon, the villagers joined. They planted new flowers and held small gatherings. The hidden gate became a symbol of friendship.
Adrian realized that secrets are not always meant to be kept. Sometimes they are meant to be shared with kindness.---The End
