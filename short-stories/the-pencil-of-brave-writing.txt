✏️ The Pencil of Brave Writing!

In a European classroom, Emil received a pencil from his teacher. She said, “Write bravely.” Emil wrote a story about helping a stranger. Clara wrote about standing up for truth.

The teacher explained, “Brave writing teaches brave hearts.” Soon, children filled notebooks with stories of courage.

From that day, the Pencil of Brave Writing reminded everyone that words can carry bravery.__The End
