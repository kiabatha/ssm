⭐ The Playground of Caring Stars!

Children played in a European school playground at night during a festival. Lanterns shone like stars. Emil said, “The stars care for us.” Clara nodded.

Soon, children began helping each other in games. The playground glowed with kindness.

The teacher explained, “Caring stars remind us that kindness shines.”

From that day, the Playground of Caring Stars reminded everyone that care can light the way.__The End
