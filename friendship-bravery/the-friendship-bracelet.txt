The Friendship Bracelet!

Lina loved making bracelets with colorful threads. One day, she decided to make a special bracelet for her best friend, Ayesha. She chose bright red, blue, and yellow threads and braided them carefully. When she gave it to Ayesha, her friend’s eyes sparkled with joy.

Soon, other children saw the bracelet and asked Lina if she could make one for them too. Lina agreed, but she told them, “Each bracelet will be different, because every friendship is special.” She made one with green and orange for Bilal, and another with purple and pink for Sara.

The children wore their bracelets proudly. They felt connected, as if the bracelets tied their hearts together. One boy said, “This bracelet reminds me that friendship is strong, even when we are apart.”

Lina realized that her small gift had created a circle of kindness. She learned that friendship is not about big presents, but about thoughtful acts that show you care.
