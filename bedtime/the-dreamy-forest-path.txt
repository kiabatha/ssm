The Dreamy Forest Path!

In Germany, Anna walked into a forest where the path glowed softly under the moon. Each step carried her deeper into dreams. Trees bent low to whisper gentle words, and streams sang lullabies that wrapped around her heart. Anna followed the path until she reached a clearing filled with stars resting on the grass. She lay down among them, feeling safe and loved. When morning came, she woke with peace, knowing the forest path would always guide her kindly.
