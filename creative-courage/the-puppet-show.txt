The Puppet Show!

Ravi loved stories, but he didn’t like standing in front of people. His voice shook whenever he had to speak in class. One afternoon, he found two old socks and drew faces on them. He gave them names—Mr. Wiggles and Miss Dot—and made them talk to each other.

Soon, Ravi had a whole cast of sock puppets. He wrote little plays for them, practicing in his room. When the school talent show was announced, Ravi’s friends signed up for singing and dancing. Ravi hesitated. Puppets seemed silly. But his heart whispered: “Try.”

On the night of the show, Ravi hid behind a small curtain. His puppets popped up, arguing, laughing, and telling jokes. The audience roared with laughter. Ravi realized they weren’t laughing at him—they were laughing with his characters.

When the show ended, Ravi peeked out shyly. The applause was loud and warm. He had found his voice, not through himself, but through his puppets.
