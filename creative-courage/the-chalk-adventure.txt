The Chalk Adventure!

Layla loved chalk. Every Saturday, she carried a box of bright sticks to the playground. While other kids played tag or climbed the jungle gym, Layla knelt on the pavement, drawing swirls, suns, and flowers. One day, she had a daring idea: she would draw a giant maze across the entire playground.

She worked for hours, sketching winding paths, dead ends, and a big star at the center. Her knees were dusty, her fingers smudged with color. When she finished, she looked at her maze proudly—but then doubt crept in. What if no one wanted to play? What if they laughed at her silly idea?

As she stood back, a boy stopped and asked, “Can I try?” He stepped into the maze, following the chalk lines. Soon, more children joined, laughing as they raced to the center. Layla’s heart soared. Her maze wasn’t silly—it was fun.

By the end of the day, the chalk was fading under running feet, but Layla didn’t mind. She had learned that creative courage meant sharing your ideas, even if they might disappear.
