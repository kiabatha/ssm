🐴 The Horse’s Secret Star!

In a European meadow lived a gentle horse named Isabella. Isabella loved the night sky. Every evening, she stood by the fence and gazed at the stars. She believed one star belonged to her. She whispered, “That star is my secret friend.”

One summer, a boy named Martin noticed her staring. He asked, “Isabella, why do you look at the sky every night?” She replied softly, “I have a secret star. It gives me hope.” Martin smiled. “Let us share your star with everyone.”

Martin gathered the children. They brought lanterns and placed them around Isabella’s meadow. When the lanterns glowed, they looked like stars on the ground. Isabella walked among them, her eyes shining. The children clapped. “Isabella’s star is here with us!”

Isabella realized that her secret star was not only in the sky. It was also in the hearts of her friends. She learned that hope grows brighter when shared.

From that day, the meadow became a place of light. Children visited at night, carrying lanterns. Isabella walked proudly among them, reminding everyone that dreams are strongest when shared with kindness.---The End
