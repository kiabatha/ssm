🏫 The Schoolyard of Gentle Voices!

Children gathered in a European schoolyard. Instead of shouting, they spoke gently. Clara said, “Gentle voices make peace.” Emil nodded.

The teacher explained, “Gentleness is strength.” Soon, the schoolyard became a place of calm joy.

From that day, the Schoolyard of Gentle Voices reminded everyone that kindness can be heard in gentle words.__The End
