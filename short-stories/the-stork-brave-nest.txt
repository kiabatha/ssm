🦩 The Stork’s Brave Nest!

On a tall tree lived a stork named Emil. His nest was high, and storms often shook it. One day, the wind grew strong. Clara the cat said, “Your nest will fall.” Emil replied, “Bravery is staying to protect my family.”

He spread his wings over the nest, guarding his eggs. The storm passed, and the nest stood safe.

The teacher owl explained, “A brave nest is built not only with sticks, but with courage.”

From that day, Emil’s nest reminded everyone that bravery protects what we love._The End
