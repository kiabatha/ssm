📖 The Unicorn of Caring Songs!

Children gathered in the schoolyard to sing. Helena sang softly, Emil played the flute, Clara clapped in rhythm. The unicorn listened, its horn glowing with each note.

The teacher explained, “Caring songs are magic for the heart. They heal sadness and bring joy.”

Soon, villagers joined. The meadow echoed with music. The unicorn danced among them, its mane glowing like a rainbow.

From that day, the Unicorn of Caring Songs reminded everyone that kindness can be sung, and that music carries care across hearts._The End
