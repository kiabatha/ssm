The Garden of Good Deeds!

In the schoolyard, there was a small garden with flowers and vegetables. The teacher told the children, “This garden will grow with your good deeds.”

Each time a child did something kind, they placed a paper flower in the garden. When Ali helped his friend with homework, he added a red flower. When Sara shared her lunch, she added a yellow one. When Amir told the truth, he added a blue flower.

Soon, the garden was full of colors. The children loved watching it grow. One day, the teacher said, “Look at this garden. It shows how kindness makes the world beautiful.”

The children clapped and promised to keep adding flowers. They learned that good deeds are like seeds. When planted, they grow into something bright and joyful.
