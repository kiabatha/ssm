🌈 The Rainbow of Gentle Words!

After rain, a rainbow appeared above a European town. Children stood together and spoke kind words. Clara said, “You are brave.” Emil said, “You are kind.”

The teacher explained, “Gentle words shine like rainbows.”

From that day, the Rainbow of Gentle Words reminded everyone that kindness can be spoken._The end
