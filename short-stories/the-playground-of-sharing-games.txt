🛝 The Playground of Sharing Games!

Children in a European school loved the playground. One afternoon, Lukas brought a ball. Instead of keeping it, he invited everyone to play. Clara said, “Sharing makes the game joyful.”

Soon, children began sharing swings, ropes, and toys. The playground became a place of laughter and friendship.

From that day, the Playground of Sharing Games reminded everyone that joy grows when shared.__The End
