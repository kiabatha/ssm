🐆 The Lynx’s Honest Hunt!

In the forest lived a lynx named Adrian. He hunted carefully, never taking more than he needed. Clara the deer asked, “Why do you stop when you could take more?” Adrian replied, “Honesty means taking only what is fair.”

He shared his food with smaller animals. Emil the squirrel said, “You are strong, but you are also honest.”

The teacher owl explained, “An honest hunt feeds not only the body, but also the heart.”

From that day, Adrian’s hunt reminded everyone that honesty makes strength noble._The End
