🍱 The Lunchbox of Honest Sharing!

Helena brought a lunchbox filled with fruit and bread. She noticed Emil had only a small piece of cheese. Helena shared her food honestly. Emil said, “Sharing makes lunch brighter.”

Soon, children began sharing food fairly. No one felt left out.

The teacher explained, “Honest sharing builds trust.”

From that day, the Lunchbox of Honest Sharing reminded everyone that kindness can be tasted.__The End
