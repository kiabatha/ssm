The Fair Game!

Sara loved board games. One afternoon, she noticed her team cheating by moving pieces when no one was looking. Her friends laughed, urging her to stay quiet.

Sara’s stomach churned. She wanted to win, but not like this. She spoke up: “That’s cheating. We need to play fair.”

Her friends frowned, but the teacher overheard and praised her. “Games are about honesty, not just winning.”

Sara realized moral courage meant speaking up, even when it makes you unpopular.
