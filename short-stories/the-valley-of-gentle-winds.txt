🍃 The Valley of Gentle Winds!

In a European countryside lay a wide valley. Gentle winds blew across the grass, carrying the scent of flowers. Children often played there, chasing kites and singing songs.

One spring, a boy named Adrian brought his flute. He played softly, and the wind carried the notes across the valley. His friends clapped. “The wind makes music,” said Clara.

The children realized that the valley was special. The wind was never harsh. It moved gently, guiding birds and bending flowers. The teacher explained, “Gentle winds remind us to be kind. Strength can be soft.”

The villagers later held a fair in the valley. They sang, danced, and flew kites together. Adrian’s flute played again, and the wind carried joy to everyone.

From that day, the Valley of Gentle Winds became a place of peace and kindness.---The End
