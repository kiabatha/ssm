🔔 The School Bell of Kindness!

Each morning, the bell rang in a European school. Children hurried inside. One day, Lukas noticed a younger boy struggling with his bag. He helped him before the bell rang.

The teacher said, “Kindness is the best way to begin the day.” Soon, children began helping each other whenever the bell rang.

From that day, the School Bell of Kindness reminded everyone that kindness is the first lesson of every morning.__The End
