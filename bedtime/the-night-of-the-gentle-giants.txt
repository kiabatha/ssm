The Night of the Gentle Giants!

In Sweden, Sofia dreamed of giants who were gentle and kind. They walked slowly across the land, carrying lanterns that lit the night. Sofia climbed onto a giant’s shoulder and saw the world glowing below. The giants whispered that strength is meant to protect, not to harm. Sofia felt safe, wrapped in their kindness. When morning came, she woke with courage, knowing that gentle strength is the truest gift.
