🐓 The Rooster’s Honest Morning!

In a European farmyard lived a rooster named Leon. Leon crowed every morning at sunrise. His voice was strong and honest.

One day, clouds covered the sky. The villagers could not see the sun. They worried about the time. Leon stood tall and crowed loudly. “It is morning!” His honest call guided them.

The children laughed. “Leon’s crow is true.” The farmer said, “Honesty begins each day.” Leon realized that his gift was not only his voice, but his truth. From that day, he crowed proudly, reminding the village that honesty brings light even when skies are dark.---The End
