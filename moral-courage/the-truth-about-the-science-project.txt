The Truth About the Science Project!

The blue liquid in the beaker fizzed and bubbled, exactly as the science book said it would. But it wasn't Sam’s mixture that was reacting; it was Sarah’s, on the lab table next to his. His own mixture was still and murky—a complete failure.

The school science fair was only an hour away. Panic set in. Then, he saw it. Sarah had left her detailed notes open on her desk when she went to get more paper. All her measurements, her steps… the secret to her success was right there.

A tempting, wicked idea whispered in his ear. Just copy it quickly. No one will ever know. You can still win.

His hand trembled as he reached for his pen. But then he looked at Sarah’s hard work—the messy handwriting, the crossed-out mistakes. This was her effort, her discovery. Claiming it as his own would be a lie dressed in first-place ribbon.

It was the hardest decision he had ever made. He put his pen down.

When the judge came to his table, Sam’s heart was pounding. He pointed to his failed experiment. “My project didn’t work,” he admitted, his face red. “I made a mistake in my measurements. But I know what I did wrong, and I’ll try again.”

He didn’t win a prize. But later, his teacher, Mr. Davis, put a hand on his shoulder. “Sam,” he said, “I saw you looking at Sarah’s notes. I also saw you choose honesty over a trophy. That kind of integrity is worth more than any first prize. I am very proud of you.”

Sarah, who had won first place, shared her prize with him—a book on famous scientists. She said he deserved it for being a true scientist of character.
