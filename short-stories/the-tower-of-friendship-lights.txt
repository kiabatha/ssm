🏰 The Tower of Friendship Lights!

In a European town stood a tall tower. At night, lanterns glowed from its windows. Children called it the Tower of Friendship Lights.

One evening, Helena and Lukas climbed the steps. They carried lanterns and placed them at the top. Soon, the tower shone across the town. Emil said, “The lights feel like friendship.”

The mayor explained, “Light grows brighter when shared.” Villagers began bringing lanterns of every color. The tower became a beacon of unity.

From that day, the Tower of Friendship Lights reminded everyone that friendship shines like light, guiding hearts with joy.---The End
