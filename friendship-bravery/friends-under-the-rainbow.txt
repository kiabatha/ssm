Friends Under the Rainbow!

One rainy afternoon, the children of the village ran outside when the clouds began to clear. A bright rainbow stretched across the sky. Sara and Amir stood together, pointing at the colors. Soon, more friends joined them. They held hands and laughed as they tried to count the seven colors.

Amir said, “This rainbow is like friendship. Each color is different, but together they make something beautiful.” Sara nodded and added, “When we are kind, we shine like colors in the sky.”
The children decided to play a game. Each person chose a color and shared a kind act they had done. Red was for helping a neighbor. Blue was for listening to a friend. Green was for sharing food. Yellow was for cheering someone up. By the end, they had a rainbow of kindness.

As the rainbow faded, the children promised to keep their friendship strong. They learned that just like the rainbow, friendship is bright when everyone adds their own color of kindness.
