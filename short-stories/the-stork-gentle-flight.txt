🦩 The Stork’s Gentle Flight!

A stork named Clara flew across the valley. She did not rush. She flew gently so smaller birds could follow. Emil the sparrow said, “Your flight makes us safe.” Helena the dove added, “We feel calm when you lead.”

The stork smiled, “Gentleness makes journeys brighter.”
The teacher owl explained, “A gentle flight carries more than wings. It carries care.”

From that day, Clara’s flight reminded everyone that gentleness is the best guide._The End
