🐾 The Ferret’s Gentle Leap!

In the meadow, a ferret named Clara wanted to leap across a stream. Emil the rabbit said, “It looks too far.” Helena the fox added, “Be gentle.”

Clara leapt softly, landing without harm. She smiled, “Gentleness makes leaps safe.”

The teacher owl explained, “A gentle leap is stronger than a wild jump.”

From that day, Clara’s leap reminded everyone that gentleness is the best strength._The End
