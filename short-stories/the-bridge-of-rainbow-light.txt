🌈 The Bridge of Rainbow Light!

In a European town stood an old stone bridge. After rain, sunlight touched the water below, and a rainbow appeared across the arch. The villagers called it the Bridge of Rainbow Light.

Children loved to cross the bridge. One day, Lukas and Helena walked together. Helena said, “The rainbow feels like a promise.” Lukas nodded. “It shows us that storms can end with beauty.”

The children decided to decorate the bridge with flowers. Soon, the bridge looked bright even without rain. Villagers gathered to celebrate. The mayor said, “This bridge teaches us that hope shines after every storm.”

From that day, the Bridge of Rainbow Light became a symbol of friendship and courage.---The End
