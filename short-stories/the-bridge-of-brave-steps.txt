🌉 The Bridge of Brave Steps!

In a European town stood a stone bridge. Children crossed bravely. Clara said, “I was afraid, but I tried.” Emil added, “Bravery makes steps lighter.”

The teacher explained, “Brave steps build trust.”

Soon, villagers crossed with courage. From that day, the Bridge of Brave Steps reminded everyone that bravery is the strongest path._The End
