🌊 The Lake of Dancing Shadows!

In a European valley lay a quiet lake. At sunset, shadows danced across the water. Children loved to watch them.

One evening, Clara and Emil sat by the shore. They saw the shadows of trees moving gently. Clara said, “The lake is alive.” Emil nodded. “The shadows dance with the wind.”

The children told their friends, and soon many gathered at sunset. They laughed and clapped as the shadows moved. The teacher explained, “The lake teaches us that beauty can be found in simple things.”

The villagers later held a lantern festival by the lake. Lights reflected on the water, joining the shadows in a joyful dance.

From that day, the Lake of Dancing Shadows became a place of wonder, reminding everyone that joy can be found in nature’s quiet gifts. __The End
