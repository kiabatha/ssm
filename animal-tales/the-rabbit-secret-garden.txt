🐇 The Rabbit’s Secret Garden!

In the countryside of France, there lived a rabbit named Clara. Clara loved plants more than anything. She spent her mornings hopping through fields, collecting seeds and tiny shoots. She dreamed of growing a garden that no one else had ever seen.

One day, Clara found a hidden corner behind an old stone wall. It was quiet and sunny. She whispered, “This will be my secret garden.” She dug small holes with her paws and planted seeds. She watered them with drops she carried in a leaf. Day by day, green shoots appeared.

Clara cared for her garden with love. She sang gentle songs to the plants. She brushed away weeds. Soon, flowers bloomed in bright colors, and vegetables grew tall. The garden became a magical place. Birds sang there, butterflies danced, and Clara felt peace.

One afternoon, a boy named Peter discovered the garden. He gasped, “This is beautiful!” Clara worried at first, but Peter promised, “I will keep your secret.” He helped her water the plants and protect them from storms. Together, they made the garden even brighter.

Soon, more children found the garden. Clara realized that secrets can be shared when they bring joy. She opened the gate and invited everyone. The garden became a place of friendship. Children played, birds sang, and Clara hopped happily among the flowers.

Clara learned that kindness is like a garden. When shared, it grows bigger and brighter.---The End
