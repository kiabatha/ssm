The Fair Turn!

Jamal loved the playground slide. One afternoon, he raced to the front of the line. Just as he was about to climb, he noticed a younger child crying. The boy had been waiting but kept getting pushed aside.

Jamal’s friends shouted, “Go! Don’t waste time!” Jamal hesitated. He wanted his turn, but he also wanted to be fair. He stepped back and said, “You go first.”

The little boy’s face lit up as he slid down, laughing. Jamal’s friends rolled their eyes, but Jamal felt proud.

Later, the teacher saw what happened and praised Jamal for his kindness. Jamal realized moral courage meant giving up something for fairness.
