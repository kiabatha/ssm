🪑 The Bench of Sharing!

In a European park stood a wooden bench. Children often sat there. One day, Lukas shared his bread with Clara. Emil shared his book.

The teacher explained, “Sharing makes places special.”
From that day, the Bench of Sharing reminded everyone that kindness can be found in simple seats._The End
