The Sharing Shoes!

Sara loved her new red shoes. They sparkled in the sunlight. One day, her friend Fatima wanted to try them on. Sara hesitated, but then she remembered that sharing brings happiness.

She gave the shoes to Fatima, who danced around with joy. Soon, other children asked to try them too. Sara let each friend wear them for a short time.

At the end of the day, the shoes were still shiny, but Sara’s heart felt even brighter. She realized that her shoes had given joy to many friends.

Her teacher said, “When you share, you do not lose. You gain smiles and friendship.”

Sara learned that sharing is like walking together. It makes the journey lighter and happier.
