🦢 The Swan’s Kind Dance!

In a European lake lived a swan named Isabella. Isabella’s feathers were white and shining. She loved to dance across the water, gliding gracefully.

One summer, the children felt sad after a storm destroyed their boats. Isabella swam to the center of the lake and began her kind dance. She spread her wings, twirled, and glided. The children laughed and clapped. “Her dance heals our hearts!”

The teacher said, “Kindness can be shown in many ways. Isabella’s dance is one of them.” Isabella realized that her gift was not beauty alone, but kindness. From that day, she danced whenever someone felt sad, teaching that joy can be shared through gentle movements.---The End
