The Costume of Stars!

Daniel’s school play was about the night sky. Everyone wore neat black costumes with silver stars sewn on. Daniel wanted something different. He glued glitter, sequins, and tiny lights onto his costume.

When he walked on stage, his costume sparkled so brightly that the audience gasped. The teacher frowned at first—it wasn’t uniform. But then the audience clapped loudly.

Daniel realized creative courage meant shining in your own way, even if it’s different.
