🏮 The Classroom of Kind Lanterns!

One winter evening, children placed lanterns in their European classroom. Each lantern carried a kind word: “Hope,” “Care,” “Friendship.”

The teacher said, “Lanterns shine like kindness.” The classroom glowed warmly.

From that day, the Classroom of Kind Lanterns reminded everyone that kindness lights the way.__The End
