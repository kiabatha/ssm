Mira’s coat had a shiny red button!
She loved it because her grandma had sewn it on. One windy day, the button popped off while she was walking in the woods.
Mira searched the path, but it was gone. A squirrel saw her looking and offered help. A bird flew above and scanned the ground. Even a rabbit joined in.
At sunset, the squirrel found the button near a tree root. Mira smiled and thanked her new friends. She sewed the button back on—and added a tiny acorn charm to remember the day.
