The Sleepy Garden!

In the Netherlands, a boy named Pieter discovered a garden that only woke at night. During the day the flowers looked ordinary, but when the moon rose, they opened with glowing colors. The roses shone like lanterns, the tulips sang soft lullabies, and the vines curled into shapes of stars. Pieter walked slowly through the paths, feeling the garden breathe around him. Fireflies joined him, lighting the way as if guiding him deeper into the dream. He sat beside a fountain that whispered stories of children who had visited before. The garden promised to guard his sleep and fill his dreams with kindness. When morning came, Pieter woke with the memory of glowing petals and gentle songs, knowing that the sleepy garden would always wait for him.
