🌳 The Friendship Treehouse!

In a European forest, children built a wooden treehouse. They carried planks, nails, and ropes. Lukas hammered carefully, Emil held the ladder, and Clara painted the walls bright yellow.

When it was finished, they climbed inside. Clara said, “This is our friendship house.” Emil added, “It is strong because we built it together.”

The teacher visited and explained, “Friendship is like wood. It grows stronger when joined.”

Soon, the treehouse became a meeting place. Children shared stories, sang songs, and even studied together. They decorated the walls with drawings of stars and hearts.

One evening, lanterns glowed inside. The forest echoed with laughter. Villagers saw the light and smiled.

From that day, the Friendship Treehouse reminded everyone that friendship builds homes in hearts._The End
