🌟 The Meadow of Caring Stars!

Near a European village stretched a wide meadow. At night, stars shone brightly above it. Children loved to lie on the grass and watch the sky.

One evening, Clara and Lukas saw the stars twinkle. Clara said, “They look like they care for us.” Lukas nodded. “They guide us with light.”

The children invited their friends. Together they sang songs under the stars. The teacher explained, “Stars remind us that care can shine even in darkness.”

Soon, villagers joined. They held small gatherings in the meadow, sharing food and stories. The meadow became a place of peace.

From that day, the Meadow of Caring Stars reminded everyone that kindness shines like starlight, guiding hearts with hope.__The End
