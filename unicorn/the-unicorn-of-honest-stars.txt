🏰 The Unicorn of Honest Stars!

Children decorated a castle with stars. Clara said, “Each star is a truth.” Emil wrote truths on paper stars. Helena hung them on the walls. The unicorn touched the stars with its horn, making them glow.

Soon, villagers added their own stars. The castle glowed with honesty, and the unicorn’s mane shone like the night sky._The End
