🌈 The Unicorn of Friendship Glow!

In a meadow filled with daisies, a unicorn appeared with a mane that shimmered like sunlight. Clara shared her bread with a hungry child, Emil helped carry books for a neighbor, and Helena encouraged a shy friend to join their game. With each act of kindness, the unicorn’s mane glowed brighter, casting light across the meadow.

The teacher explained, “Friendship glows when shared. It is not kept in silence but shines when given freely.”

Soon, villagers came to the meadow. They brought stories of friendship, laughter, and care. The unicorn’s glow spread across the village, reminding everyone that friendship is the brightest light._The End
