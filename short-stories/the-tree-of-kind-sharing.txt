🌳 The Tree of Kind Sharing!

In a European park grew a tall tree. Children played under it. One day, Clara shared her book, Emil shared his flute, and Lukas shared his bread.

The teacher explained, “Sharing makes roots strong.”

From that day, the Tree of Kind Sharing reminded everyone that kindness grows like branches._The End
