The Bedtime Treasure Box!

In Denmark, Erik discovered a wooden box beside his bed. It was carved with stars and moons, and each night it opened by itself. Inside were treasures that glowed: a silver key, a golden feather, and a tiny bell. When Erik touched the key, he dreamed of opening doors to hidden gardens. When he held the feather, he flew across skies filled with laughter. When he rang the bell, he met children from every land who shared stories of hope. The box reminded him that dreams are treasures waiting to be found. Erik woke each morning with joy, knowing that bedtime was not an ending but a doorway to wonders.
