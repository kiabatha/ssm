🏰 The Unicorn of Friendship Magic!

Children climbed a tower and shouted words of friendship. Clara said, “I will help.” Emil said, “I will share.” Helena said, “I will speak kindly.” The unicorn’s mane glowed with each word.

The teacher explained, “Friendship is the strongest magic.”

Soon, villagers joined. The tower became a beacon of unity. The unicorn stood at the top, its horn glowing like a star.

From that day, the Unicorn of Friendship Magic reminded everyone that friendship shines like light._The End
