🎶 The Playground of Caring Songs1

In a European school playground, children sang together. Clara sang softly, Emil played the flute, and Helena clapped.

The teacher explained, “Songs carry care. They make hearts gentle.”

Soon, the playground became a place of music and kindness.

From that day, the Playground of Caring Songs reminded everyone that care can be heard in music.__The End
