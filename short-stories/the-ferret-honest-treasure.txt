🐾 The Ferret’s Honest Treasure!

In the meadow, a ferret named Clara found a shiny stone. She could have hidden it, but she showed it to her friends. Emil the rabbit said, “It is beautiful.” Helena the fox asked, “Will you keep it?” Clara replied, “Honesty means sharing treasures.”

She placed the stone in the center of the meadow so everyone could enjoy it.

The teacher owl explained, “An honest treasure is brighter when shared.”

From that day, Clara’s treasure reminded everyone that honesty makes gifts glow._The End
