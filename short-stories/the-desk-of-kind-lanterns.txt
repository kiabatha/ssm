🪑 The Desk of Kind Lanterns!

In a European classroom, children placed small lanterns on their desks. Each lantern carried a kind word. Clara wrote “Friendship.” Emil wrote “Truth.”

The desks glowed warmly. The teacher said, “Kind lanterns light our learning.”

From that day, the Desk of Kind Lanterns reminded everyone that kindness can shine even in study.__The End
