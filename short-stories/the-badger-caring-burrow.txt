🦡 The Badger’s Caring Burrow!

In the forest, a badger named Lukas built a burrow. He made it wide so friends could rest inside. Clara the hedgehog came when rain fell. Emil the fox arrived when the wind blew.

The badger said, “A burrow is not only for me. It is for everyone.”

The teacher owl explained, “Caring builds homes stronger than stone.”

From that day, Lukas’s burrow reminded everyone that care is the warmest shelter._The End
