The Sleepy Train Ride!

In Switzerland, Anna boarded a small train that ran through the mountains. The train was special, because at night it carried children into dreams. The seats were soft, the lamps glowed gently, and the sound of the wheels was like a lullaby. Anna looked out the window and saw valleys filled with silver mist and peaks shining under the moon. Other children on the train smiled as they drifted into sleep. The train carried them across bridges of light, through tunnels of stars, and into lands where kindness ruled. Anna felt safe, wrapped in the rhythm of the ride. When the train stopped, she stepped into a dream where she danced with clouds and sang with rivers. In the morning she woke in her bed, but she remembered the train’s promise: every night it would return to carry her gently into sleep.
