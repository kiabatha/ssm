🗣️ The Classroom of Brave Voices!

Children in a European classroom were asked to speak aloud. Some felt shy. Lukas stood first and read a poem. Helena followed with a story. Emil sang a song.

The teacher said, “Brave voices make learning strong.”

From that day, the Classroom of Brave Voices reminded everyone that courage can be heard.__The End
