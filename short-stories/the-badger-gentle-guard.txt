🦡 The Badger’s Gentle Guard!

A badger named Lukas built a guard post near his burrow. He did not guard with anger. He guarded with gentleness. Clara the hedgehog asked, “Why do you smile while guarding?” Lukas answered, “Gentleness makes others feel safe.”

When storms came, he guided animals into shelter. Emil the fox said, “You are strong, but your gentleness is greater.”
The teacher owl explained, “A gentle guard protects more than walls.”

From that day, Lukas’s guard reminded everyone that gentleness is the strongest shield._The End
