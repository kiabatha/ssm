It was an accident. A big one.

Leo had been showing off his new remote-controlled car in the park when he lost control. It zipped straight under a bench and crashed hard into Mr. Benson’s beautiful flowerpot. The red ceramic pot, his favorite, lay in pieces on the path.

Leo’s first instinct was to run. Mr. Benson was a kind but strict old man. What if he yells at me? What if he tells my parents? Leo’s legs itched to carry him away. He hid behind a big tree, his heart pounding.

He watched Mr. Benson come out, sigh sadly, and start picking up the pieces. He didn’t look angry, just disappointed. That felt worse to Leo than any shouting.

Gathering every bit of his courage, Leo stepped out from behind the tree. His feet felt like heavy bricks. “Mr. Benson,” he whispered, his eyes filling with tears. “I’m so sorry. It was my car. It was an accident.”

Mr. Benson looked up. He was quiet for a moment, which felt like forever. Then, he nodded. “Thank you for telling me, Leo. That was the brave thing to do.”

“I’ll help you clean up,” Leo said. “And I’ll use my allowance to buy you a new one.”

A small smile appeared on Mr. Benson’s face. “The new pot isn’t what matters most, Leo. Your honesty is.”
