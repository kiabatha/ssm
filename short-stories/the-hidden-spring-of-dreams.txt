💧 The Hidden Spring of Dreams!

In a European forest, children often played near tall pines. One summer, Clara and Emil followed a deer into the woods. They discovered a small spring hidden between rocks. The water sparkled in the sunlight.

Clara whispered, “It feels magical.” Emil nodded. “Let us make a wish.” They closed their eyes and dreamed of kindness and courage.

The teacher explained, “Springs give life to rivers. Dreams give life to hearts.” The children realized that the spring was special. They built a small wooden fence to protect it.

Soon, villagers visited the spring. They drank the cool water and shared their dreams. The mayor said, “This spring teaches us hope.”

From that day, the Hidden Spring of Dreams became a place where children learned that dreams grow when cared for.---The End
