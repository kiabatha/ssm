The Sleepy Teddy’s Adventure!

In Switzerland, Leo hugged his teddy each night. One evening the teddy opened its eyes and whispered, “Let us go.” Together they walked into dreams where mountains glowed and rivers sang. The teddy carried Leo across bridges of light, guarding him with gentle strength. They met children who shared stories of courage, and Leo felt brave with his friend beside him. When morning came, the teddy closed its eyes again, but Leo knew the adventure would return each night.
