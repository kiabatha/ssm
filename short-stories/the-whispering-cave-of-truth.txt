🗣️ The Whispering Cave of Truth!

In a European hillside lay a cave that villagers called the Cave of Truth. When the wind blew inside, it made soft whispers. Children often wondered what the whispers meant.

One day, Helena and Emil entered with lanterns. They listened carefully. The cave whispered, “Be kind. Be honest.” Helena said, “It feels like the cave is teaching us.” Emil nodded. “Truth speaks even in silence.”

The children told their teacher. She explained, “Truth is like an echo. It always returns, no matter how far it travels.”

Soon, villagers visited the cave. They shared promises and spoke honestly. The cave became a place of respect.

From that day, the Whispering Cave of Truth reminded everyone that honesty is the strongest voice.---The End
