🦢 The Goose’s Brave Swim!

In a wide river lived a goose named Clara. One day, the water grew strong after rain. The animals stood at the edge, afraid to cross. Clara stepped forward. “I will swim first,” she said.

She moved slowly, her wings steady. Emil the rabbit watched with worry. Helena the fox called, “Be careful!” Clara swam bravely, guiding the smaller animals behind her.

When they reached the other side, the animals cheered. Clara smiled, “Bravery is not about being the fastest. It is about helping others when they are afraid.”

The teacher owl explained, “A brave swim shows courage in gentle ways.”

From that day, Clara’s swim reminded everyone that bravery can carry friends across strong waters._The End
