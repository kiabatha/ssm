🐕 The Hound’s Gentle Guard!

In a European village lived a hound named Lukas. Lukas guarded the homes at night. His bark was strong, but his heart was gentle.

One evening, a storm frightened the children. Lukas walked calmly through the streets, guarding each door. He barked softly to reassure them. The children whispered, “Lukas makes us feel safe.”

The baker said, “His guard is gentle, not harsh.” Lukas realized that protection is not about fear. It is about care. From that day, he guarded proudly, teaching the village that gentleness can be the strongest shield.---The End
