🎒 The Backpack of Friendship!

Lukas carried a backpack to school. One day, he placed small notes inside for his friends: “Thank you,” “Be brave,” “You are kind.”

Clara and Emil smiled when they found the notes. Soon, other children began writing messages too.

The teacher explained, “Friendship grows when we share words of care.”

From that day, the Backpack of Friendship reminded everyone that friendship can be carried everywhere.__The End
