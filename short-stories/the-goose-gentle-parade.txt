🦢 The Goose’s Gentle Parade!

In a meadow, a goose named Helena led a parade of animals. She walked slowly so even the smallest could join. Emil the squirrel marched beside her, carrying acorns. Clara the cat followed, waving her tail.

The goose said, “Gentleness makes everyone welcome.” The parade passed through the village, and children clapped with joy. The animals felt proud, not because they were strong, but because they were gentle.

The teacher owl explained, “Gentleness is a parade that never ends.”

From that day, Helena’s gentle parade reminded everyone that kindness is the best celebration._The End
