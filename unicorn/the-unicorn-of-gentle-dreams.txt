🏰 The Unicorn of Gentle Dreams!

Inside a castle, children shared dreams. Helena dreamed of teaching, Emil dreamed of painting skies, Clara dreamed of helping others. The unicorn’s mane glowed with each gentle dream.

The teacher explained, “Gentle dreams are the strongest hope. They guide us to kindness.”

Soon, villagers visited the castle to share their own dreams. The unicorn’s glow filled the halls, reminding everyone that kindness makes dreams shine._The End
