🍰 The Bakery of Gentle Cakes!

In a European village stood a bakery where cakes were baked with gentleness. Clara helped decorate with soft cream. Emil added fruit carefully. Helena whispered kind words while baking.

The teacher explained, “Gentleness makes food sweeter than sugar.”

Soon, villagers visited not only for taste but for kindness.

From that day, the Bakery of Gentle Cakes reminded everyone that gentleness can be shared like dessert._The End
