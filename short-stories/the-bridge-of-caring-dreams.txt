🌉 The Bridge of Caring Dreams!

In a European town stood a bridge. Children crossed while sharing dreams. Clara said, “I dream of teaching.” Emil said, “I dream of painting.” Helena said, “I dream of helping others.”

The bridge glowed with each caring dream. The teacher explained, “Dreams are strongest when shared kindly.”

From that day, the Bridge of Caring Dreams reminded everyone that care makes dreams stronger._The End
