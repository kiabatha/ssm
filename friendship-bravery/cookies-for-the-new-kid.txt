Cookies for the New Kid!

A new boy named Sami joined the class. He sat quietly, looking shy. The other children whispered, unsure how to talk to him.

Fatima had an idea. She baked cookies with her mother and brought them to school. At lunch, she walked to Sami and said, “Would you like a cookie?” Sami’s eyes widened. He took one and smiled.

Soon, other children gathered. They shared cookies and stories. Sami laughed for the first time. He told them about his old school and his favorite games.

By the end of the day, Sami was no longer the “new kid.” He was part of the group. Fatima learned that kindness can be as simple as sharing cookies.
