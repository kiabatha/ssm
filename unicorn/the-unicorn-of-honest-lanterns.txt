🏮 The Unicorn of Honest Lanterns!

In the town square, children lit lanterns. Clara said, “This lantern carries truth.” Emil admitted, “I was afraid, but I spoke honestly.” Helena encouraged, “Truth makes us strong.”

The unicorn touched each lantern with its horn, making them glow brighter.

The teacher explained, “Honest lanterns guide us like stars. They shine when truth is spoken.”

Soon, villagers added their own lanterns. The square glowed with honesty, and the unicorn’s horn shone like the moon._The End
