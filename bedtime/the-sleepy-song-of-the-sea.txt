The Sleepy Song of the Sea!

On the coast of Portugal, a boy named Tomas listened to the sea each night. The waves carried a rhythm that sounded like a lullaby. One evening the sea grew brighter, and Tomas saw silver dolphins leaping in the moonlight. They sang with voices that blended into the waves, creating a song that wrapped around him like a blanket. Tomas closed his eyes and dreamed of sailing across oceans where every island welcomed him with joy. He met children who built castles of sand that glowed like gold, and he shared laughter with dolphins that guided his ship. When morning arrived, Tomas woke with the sound of the sea still in his ears, gentle and kind, reminding him that the ocean itself was a friend.
