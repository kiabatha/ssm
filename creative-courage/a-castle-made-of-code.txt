A Castle Made of Code!

Liam loved building castles, but not from blocks or LEGOs. He built them from code on his computer. For weeks, he had been working on his masterpiece—a soaring, digital castle with shimmering turrets and a bridge that could lower and rise. It was his secret world.

His school was having a "Digital Creations" showcase. His friends were showing funny animations and simple games. Liam was sure no one would understand his castle. They would think it was weird or boring. The fear of being misunderstood was a heavy lock on his creativity. He decided not to enter.

The night before the showcase, he was showing his little sister how the drawbridge worked. Her eyes widened with wonder. "It's magic!" she whispered. "You made a magic castle!"

Her wonder was the key that unlocked his courage. If his castle could bring magic to one person, it was worth sharing.
At the showcase, he set up his laptop with a sign that said, "The Crystal Castle - Step Inside." At first, people walked by. But then, a girl put on the headphones and her jaw dropped.

She spent ten minutes exploring every room. Soon, there was a small line of kids waiting to try it. They weren't just looking at it; they were in it. They were experiencing the world he had built from nothing but lines of code and his own imagination. Liam learned that creative courage is about sharing the worlds you build inside your mind, because you never know who might find magic in them.
