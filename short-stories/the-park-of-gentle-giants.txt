🌳 The Park of Gentle Giants!

Children visited a park where statues of gentle giants stood. Clara said, “They are strong, but kind.” Emil nodded, “Gentleness is true courage.”

The teacher explained, “Gentle giants remind us that strength can be kind.”

Soon, villagers visited to learn from the statues. From that day, the Park of Gentle Giants reminded everyone that gentleness is the greatest strength._The End
