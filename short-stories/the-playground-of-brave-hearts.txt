❤️ The Playground of Brave Hearts!

Children in a European school loved the playground. One day, a new student felt shy. Clara invited him to join a game. Lukas said, “Bravery is showing kindness.”

Soon, children began helping each other in games. They stood up for friends and played fairly.

The teacher explained, “Brave hearts make strong friendships.”

From that day, the Playground of Brave Hearts reminded everyone that courage can be gentle.__The End
