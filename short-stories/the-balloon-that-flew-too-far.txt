At Sami’s birthday party, a red balloon slipped away.
It floated above the trees, past rooftops, and into the sky. The balloon met birds, clouds, and even a kite.
It missed the laughter below, but the sky was full of stories. After a long journey, the balloon drifted down and landed in a quiet garden.
A child found it and smiled. The balloon had flown far—but it still made someone happy.
