🦩 The Stork’s Caring Journey!

A stork named Emil flew across valleys. He carried food for smaller birds. Clara the cat asked, “Why do you fly so far?” Emil answered, “Caring makes journeys worth the effort.”

He shared food with sparrows and guided them to safe nests.
The teacher owl explained, “A caring journey is longer, but it is always brighter.”

From that day, Emil’s journey reminded everyone that care is the best travel._The End
