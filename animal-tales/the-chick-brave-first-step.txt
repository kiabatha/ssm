🐤 the chick’s brave first step!

In a European farmyard lived a chick named Elise. Elise was small and fluffy. She watched the older hens walk proudly across the yard, but she felt afraid to take her first step outside the nest.

One morning, the farmer’s daughter, Anna, whispered, “Elise, you can do it.” Elise looked at the bright yard. She took one tiny step, then another. She stumbled, but she kept moving. The children clapped. “Elise is brave!”

Elise realized that bravery is not about being big. It is about trying something new. From that day, she walked proudly, teaching others that every journey begins with a first step.---The End
