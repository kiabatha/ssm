The Sleepy Lantern!

In Norway, Erik found a lantern by his bed. Each night it lit itself, glowing softly with golden warmth. When Erik held it, the lantern carried him into dreams where forests sang and rivers danced. He followed its light through paths of wonder, meeting gentle animals who guided him with kindness. The lantern whispered that every child carries a light inside, strong enough to brighten even the darkest night. Erik woke each morning with peace, knowing his lantern would always shine for him.
