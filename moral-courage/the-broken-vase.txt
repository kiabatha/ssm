The Broken Vase!

Amir was playing in his aunt’s living room when his elbow knocked over a vase. It shattered into pieces. His stomach twisted. He could hide and pretend it wasn’t him.

But when his aunt came in, Amir looked at her with tears in his eyes. “I broke it,” he whispered.
She sighed, then hugged him. “Thank you for telling me. Things can be replaced. Honesty cannot.”

Amir realized moral courage meant owning up to mistakes instead of hiding them.
