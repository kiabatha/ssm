🕯️ The Badger’s Brave Lantern!

In the forest, a badger named Lukas carried a lantern. One night, a storm made the woods dark. Clara the hedgehog said, “We cannot see the path.” Emil the fox added, “We are afraid.”

Lukas lifted his lantern high. “Bravery is showing light when others fear,” he said. He guided the animals through the storm. His lantern glowed brighter with each step.

The teacher owl explained, “A brave lantern shines even in the strongest storm.”

From that day, Lukas’s lantern reminded everyone that courage can guide friends home._The End
