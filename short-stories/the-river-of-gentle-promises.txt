🌊 The River of Gentle Promises!

In a European village flowed a calm river. Children often played by its bank. One day, Clara and Emil promised each other to meet there every week.

They built small boats from wood and placed notes inside. Each note carried a promise: “Be kind,” “Help others,” “Stay brave.” The boats floated gently downstream.

The teacher explained, “Promises are like rivers. They flow when we keep them.”

Soon, villagers joined. They wrote promises and sent them across the water. Smiles spread through the town.

From that day, the River of Gentle Promises reminded everyone that hope grows when promises are kept with care.---The End
