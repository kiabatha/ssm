In ancient times, there was a slave in Rome named Androcles. His master was very cruel. Androcles had to work in the fields all day long, hungry and thirsty, and received no reward for his labor.

One night, when it was dark and Androcles' cruel master was sleeping peacefully, Androcles, tired of the oppression, fled into the forest. He ran until he reached a cave in the middle of the forest.

Exhausted, he decided to rest there for the night and soon fell into a deep sleep. A short while after he had fallen asleep, a lion came to the entrance of the cave and roared loudly.

When Androcles saw the lion, he was frightened. The lion was in pain and had a thorn stuck in its paw. Carefully, Androcles removed the thorn from the lion's paw.

The lion realized that Androcles was helping it and did not attack him. Androcles then left the cave and continued on his way.

Later, Androcles' master arrived with his soldiers and captured him. "Arrest him" He was thrown into prison and preparations were made to punish him severely.

A few days later, people were gathered together, and a hungry lion was brought into a cage.

Everyone was anxious to see what would happen. Androcles was thrown in front of the hungry lion. The lion recognized Androcles; it was the same lion that Androcles had helped. The lion began licking Androcles' face as if to thank him.

"When this lion did not forget his service, how could I forget his service?" said the emperor, and both were set free.

The lion and Androcles were both freed. They were very happy with their release.
