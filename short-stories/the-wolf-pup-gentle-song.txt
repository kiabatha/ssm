🐺 The Wolf Pup’s Gentle Song!

In the forest, a wolf pup named Adrian sang softly. His song was gentle, not fierce. Clara the deer listened, Emil the rabbit joined.

The wolf pup said, “Gentleness makes songs sweeter.”
The teacher owl explained, “A gentle song is stronger than a loud roar.”

From that day, Adrian’s song reminded everyone that gentleness is music for the heart._The End
