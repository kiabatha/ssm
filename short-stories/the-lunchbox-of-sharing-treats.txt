🍱 The Lunchbox of Sharing Treats!

Helena brought a lunchbox to her European school. It was filled with bread, cheese, and fruit. She noticed Emil had no lunch. Helena shared her food. Emil smiled. “Sharing makes lunch sweeter.”

Soon, children began sharing treats every day. Apples, cakes, and sandwiches passed from hand to hand.

The teacher said, “Sharing builds friendship.” From that day, the Lunchbox of Sharing Treats reminded everyone that kindness can be tasted.__The End
