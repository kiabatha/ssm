The Playground Apology!

Yusuf loved running races on the playground. One afternoon, he sprinted so fast that he accidentally bumped into another boy, knocking him down. The boy scraped his knee and winced in pain.

Yusuf froze. His friends shouted, “Keep running! It wasn’t your fault.” But Yusuf’s heart told him otherwise. He walked back, helped the boy up, and said, “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you.”
The boy smiled weakly. “Thanks. I know it was an accident.”

The teacher saw and nodded approvingly. Yusuf realized moral courage meant admitting mistakes and making them right, even when others tell you to ignore them.
