The lunchroom was buzzing with noise and laughter, but at their usual table, a storm was brewing. Maya’s brand-new lunchbox—the one with the sparkly unicorn her grandma had given her—was open and empty. Her special chocolate muffin was gone.

“I saw Liam near your bag before lunch,” Sara whispered, pointing to a boy from another class. Liam often sat alone and sometimes looked grumpy. Maya felt a hot rush of anger. How could he?

She marched over to his table, her hands balled into fists. “Did you take my muffin?” she demanded.

Liam jumped, his eyes wide with fear. He shook his head, but his cheeks turned bright red. Maya was about to yell when she noticed something. His hands were trembling, and he looked like he was about to cry. Her anger melted away, replaced by a strange feeling of curiosity.

She took a deep breath and sat down opposite him. “Liam,” she said, her voice much softer now. “Are you okay?”
Tears welled up in his eyes. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, staring at the table. “I forgot my lunch… and I was so hungry. My dad lost his job, and… we don’t have much right now.”

Maya’s heart felt heavy. She hadn’t thought about why someone would take food. Being hungry must feel awful.

“It’s okay,” she said gently. “But you can always ask if you need something. My mom always packs extra.” She went back to her table, divided her sandwich and apple, and brought half to Liam. “Friends?” she asked.
Liam nodded, a real smile breaking through his tears. “Friends.”

From that day on, Maya always made sure to save a seat for Liam at her table.
