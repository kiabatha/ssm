The Hug That Saved the Day!

One morning, Sara felt upset because she had lost her notebook. She sat quietly in the corner of the classroom. Her friend Ayesha noticed and walked over. She did not know what to say, so she simply gave Sara a big hug.

Sara felt her sadness melt away. She smiled and whispered, “Thank you. I needed that.” Later, the teacher found the notebook and returned it. Sara realized that the hug had helped her more than the notebook itself.

The other children saw what had happened. They began to give hugs when someone felt sad or worried. Soon, the classroom was full of warmth and laughter.

Sara learned that sometimes friendship is not about solving problems, but about standing close and showing care.
