🏰 The Unicorn of Gentle Giants!

In a castle on a hill lived gentle giants and a unicorn. Lukas built benches for visitors, Clara encouraged him, Emil protected younger children. The unicorn’s horn glowed whenever gentleness was shown.

The teacher explained, “Gentle giants and unicorns remind us that strength can be kind.”

Soon, villagers visited the castle not to fear giants but to learn from them. The unicorn walked beside the giants, teaching children that courage is not loud but gentle.

From that day, the Unicorn of Gentle Giants reminded everyone that kindness is the greatest strength, and that even giants can be gentle._The End
