🛍️ The Market of Friendship Lights!

In a European town square, children visited a market decorated with lanterns. Clara said, “Each lantern is a friendship.” Emil added, “They glow when shared.”

The teacher explained, “Friendship lights guide us like stars.”

Soon, villagers joined. They added their own lanterns.

From that day, the Market of Friendship Lights reminded everyone that friendship shines brightest when shared._The End
