🐴 The Pony’s Gentle Journey!

In a European meadow lived a pony named Emilia. Emilia was small but strong. She loved carrying children across the fields, always walking gently so they felt safe.

One summer, the village planned a trip to the river. The children worried about crossing the long path. Emilia knelt down and said, “Climb on. I will take you.” She walked slowly, stopping to let them rest. Her gentle steps made the journey peaceful.

At the river, the children clapped. “Emilia’s journey is gentle and kind.” The mayor said, “Strength is not only speed. It is care.” Emilia realized that her gift was not power, but gentleness.

From that day, Emilia carried children proudly, teaching them that kindness makes every journey brighter.---The End
