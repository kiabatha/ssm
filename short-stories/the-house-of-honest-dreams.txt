🏠 The House of Honest Dreams!

On a hill stood a house where children shared dreams. Clara dreamed of teaching. Emil dreamed of painting. Helena dreamed of helping others.

The walls glowed with each honest dream. The teacher explained, “Dreams are strongest when spoken truthfully.”

Soon, villagers visited. They added their own dreams.

From that day, the House of Honest Dreams reminded everyone that honesty makes dreams shine._The End
