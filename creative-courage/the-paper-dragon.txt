
The Paper Dragon!

Kenji loved origami. He could fold cranes, frogs, and flowers with ease. But his favorite creation was the dragon. He had tried dozens of times to make one that looked fierce and majestic, but his dragons always came out crooked—one wing bigger than the other, tails bent awkwardly, and faces that looked more silly than scary.

When the town festival announced an origami contest, Kenji’s friends encouraged him to enter. “Show them your crane!” they said. “It’s perfect.” But Kenji didn’t want to show a crane. He wanted to show his dragon, even though it wasn’t perfect.

The night before the festival, Kenji sat at his desk, folding paper again and again. His fingers trembled as he pressed the creases. The dragon looked clumsy, but it was his. He thought about hiding it and entering something safe. But then he remembered his grandfather’s words: “A dragon isn’t meant to be perfect. It’s meant to be powerful.”

At the festival, tables were filled with flawless origami—delicate flowers, sharp cranes, and intricate boxes. Kenji placed his crooked dragon in the center of his table. People walked by, some smiling politely, others moving on quickly. Kenji’s heart sank.

Then a little boy stopped. He stared at the dragon, eyes wide. “It looks like it’s flying!” he said. He picked it up carefully and made it swoop through the air. Soon other children gathered, laughing and pretending the dragon was breathing fire.

Kenji realized something important: his dragon wasn’t perfect, but it was alive. It sparked imagination. That was worth more than perfection.
