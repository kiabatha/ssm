🏮 The Lanterns of the Forest Fair!

In a European forest, villagers held a fair each autumn. They decorated the trees with lanterns of every color. Children loved the glowing lights.

One year, Clara and Lukas helped prepare. They hung lanterns high and low. When night came, the forest shone like a rainbow. Music played, and children danced.

A boy named Emil whispered, “The lanterns make the forest feel alive.” The mayor said, “They remind us that joy grows when we gather together.”

The fair became more than games and food. It became a celebration of kindness and unity.

From that day, the Lanterns of the Forest Fair taught children that light is brighter when shared. __The End
