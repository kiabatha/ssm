🦚 The Peacock’s Kind Dance!

In a garden, a peacock named Clara spread her feathers. Instead of showing off, she invited others to dance. Emil the sparrow hopped happily, Helena the rabbit twirled.

The peacock said, “Kindness is sharing beauty, not keeping it.”

The teacher owl explained, “A kind dance is brighter than jewels.”

From that day, Clara’s dance reminded everyone that kindness is the best performance._The End
