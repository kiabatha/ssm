🌊 The River’s Secret Song!

In a European valley flowed a gentle river. Villagers said the river carried a secret song. Children often sat by the bank, listening to the water.

One summer, a girl named Sofia heard a melody in the ripples. She told her brother Emil, “The river sings.” Emil laughed kindly, but when he listened, he heard it too. The song was soft, like a lullaby.

The children shared the discovery with their teacher. She explained, “The river sings because it carries life. Fish swim, stones roll, and water flows. Together they make music.”

The children decided to follow the river upstream. They found waterfalls, streams, and hidden pools. Each place had a different sound. They wrote notes in their books, calling it “The River’s Secret Song.”

At the village fair, the children performed the melody with flutes and drums. The villagers clapped. “The river teaches us harmony,” said the mayor.

From that day, the children listened more carefully to nature. They realized that every sound carries meaning, and every song teaches kindness.---The End
