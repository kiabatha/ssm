The Sleepy Whisper!

In Portugal, Ines heard a whisper at night. It was soft, like the wind, but it carried dreams. The whisper told her stories of children who built kindness across the world. Ines closed her eyes and followed the sound into dreams where rivers sang and stars danced. She felt safe, wrapped in gentle words. When morning came, she woke with peace, knowing the whisper would always return.
