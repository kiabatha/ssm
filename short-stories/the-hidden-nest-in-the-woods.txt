🪺 The Hidden Nest in the Woods!

In a European forest, children often played among tall trees. One spring, Clara and Emil discovered a small nest hidden in the branches. Inside were three tiny eggs.

Clara whispered, “We must protect them.” Emil nodded. They built a small fence of sticks around the tree so no one would disturb the nest.

Every day, the children visited quietly. They watched the mother bird bring food and sing softly. Soon, the eggs cracked, and three chicks appeared. The children clapped with joy.

The teacher explained, “The nest teaches us care. When we protect life, it grows strong.”

The villagers later came to see. They promised to guard the woods and keep them safe.

From that day, the Hidden Nest in the Woods reminded everyone that kindness protects even the smallest lives.---The End
