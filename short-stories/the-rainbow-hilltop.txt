🌈 The Rainbow Hilltop!

In a European countryside stood a hill. After rain, a rainbow often appeared above it. Children loved to climb the hill to see the colors.

One afternoon, Lukas and Clara reached the top. They saw the rainbow stretch across the sky. Lukas said, “It feels like a bridge of hope.” Clara nodded. “It shows us that storms can end with beauty.”

The children invited their friends. Together they sang and played under the rainbow. The villagers joined, bringing food and music. The hilltop became a place of joy.

The mayor said, “This rainbow teaches us that hope shines after every storm.”

From that day, the Rainbow Hilltop reminded everyone that light and color can follow even the darkest clouds.---The End
