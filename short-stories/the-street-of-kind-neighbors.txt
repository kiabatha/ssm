🚶 The Street of Kind Neighbors!

In a European town, children walked along a street where neighbors greeted each other kindly. Clara helped an old woman carry her basket. Emil watered flowers for a neighbor. Helena shared bread with a hungry child.

The teacher explained, “Kindness makes streets brighter than lanterns.” Soon, the street became famous. Travelers said, “This is the Street of Kind Neighbors.” From that day, the street reminded everyone that kindness builds the strongest community._The End
