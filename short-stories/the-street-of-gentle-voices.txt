🚶 The Street of Gentle Voices!

In a European town, children walked along a street where gentle voices filled the air. Clara greeted kindly, Emil spoke softly, Helena encouraged a shy child.

The teacher explained, “Gentle voices are stronger than loud shouts.”

Soon, villagers joined. The street became known as the Street of Gentle Voices. From that day, it reminded everyone that kindness can be spoken in gentle tones._The End
