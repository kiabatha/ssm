🦆 The Duck’s Courageous Swim!

In a European village by a wide river lived a duck named Helena. Helena loved the water, but she was afraid of swimming across the strong current. She stayed close to the shore, watching other ducks glide easily. She whispered, “I wish I could be brave like them.”

One summer, the children planned a race across the river. They invited Helena. She shook her head. “I am too afraid.” A boy named Stefan said kindly, “Courage is not about being fearless. It is about trying even when you are afraid.”

Helena thought about his words. On the day of the race, she stood at the edge of the river. The other ducks leapt in. Helena hesitated, then took a deep breath and paddled forward. The current pushed her back, but she kept moving. Step by step, stroke by stroke, she crossed the river.

The children clapped loudly. Stefan shouted, “Helena, you did it! You are the bravest duck.” Helena realized that courage is not about winning. It is about facing fear and moving forward. From that day, she swam proudly across the river, teaching others that bravery grows when we try.---The End
