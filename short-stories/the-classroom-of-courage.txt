🏫 The Classroom of Courage!

In a European school, children gathered in a bright classroom. Their teacher, Madame Clara, asked them to share moments when they felt afraid but still tried. Lukas spoke about reading aloud even when nervous. Helena shared how she helped a new student.

Clara said, “Courage grows when we face challenges with hope.” The children realized that the classroom was more than desks and books. It was a place where bravery was learned.

From that day, the Classroom of Courage reminded everyone that courage begins with small steps.__The End
