🌸 The Secret Garden Schoolhouse!

Behind a gate in a European town stood a small garden. In the center was a wooden schoolhouse. Few people knew about it.

One day, Clara and Emil discovered the place. They entered and found benches under trees. Birds sang, and flowers bloomed. Clara said, “This is a secret school.”

The children studied there with joy. They learned about plants, stars, and kindness. The teacher explained, “Learning grows stronger when surrounded by beauty.”

Soon, villagers joined. They decorated the schoolhouse with lanterns and flowers.

From that day, the Secret Garden Schoolhouse became a place where children learned with hope and peace.---The End
