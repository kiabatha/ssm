The Pillow That Told Stories!

In a small village in Austria, a boy named Lukas had a pillow that whispered tales each night. When he laid his head down, the pillow spoke of knights who guarded castles, of rivers that sang, and of children who built bridges of light. Lukas listened with wide eyes, feeling the stories wrap around him like a gentle song. Each morning he woke with courage, ready to live kindly, because the pillow reminded him that every child carries a story worth telling.
