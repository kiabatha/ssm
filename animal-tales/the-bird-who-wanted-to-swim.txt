🐦 The Bird Who Wanted To Swim!

In a small town by a lake, there lived a curious bird named Clara. Clara loved flying high above the rooftops, but she always wondered what it would feel like to swim. She watched children splashing in the lake and whispered, “I wish I could swim like them.”
Her friends laughed kindly. “Birds are made to fly, not swim,” said her cousin Leo. But Clara did not give up. She practiced by dipping her wings into the water. She floated for a moment, then flapped back to the shore. Each day she tried again.

One afternoon, a boy named Daniel saw her struggling. He said, “Clara, I will teach you. Swimming is about trust in the water.” He showed her how to move slowly, how to float, and how to paddle gently. Clara listened carefully.

At first, she sank and splashed. But Daniel encouraged her. “Do not be afraid. Try again.” Clara kept practicing. Soon, she could float on the surface. She paddled with her wings and glided across the lake. The children cheered.

Clara realized that dreams may seem impossible, but with courage and help, they can come true. She did not stop flying, but now she also loved swimming. She taught other birds to try, and together they discovered new joy.

The villagers smiled when they saw Clara swimming beside the children. They said, “This bird reminds us that courage can change what seems impossible.”

Clara learned that bravery is not about being perfect. It is about trying again until hope becomes real.---The End
