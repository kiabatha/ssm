🦉 The Little Owl’s Courageous Flight!

In a European forest lived a little owl named Felix. Felix was young and afraid of flying at night. He stayed close to the nest, watching the stars.

One evening, a storm blew through the forest. The animals needed help. Felix whispered, “I must be brave.” He spread his wings and flew into the dark. The wind pushed him, but he kept moving. He guided the animals to shelter with his calls.

The children who lived nearby clapped. “Felix’s flight is courageous!” The elder owl said, “Bravery is not about size. It is about facing fear.” Felix realized that his gift was courage. From that day, he flew proudly, teaching others that even small wings can carry great strength.---The End
