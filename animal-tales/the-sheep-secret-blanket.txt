🐑 The Sheep’s Secret Blanket!

In a European valley lived a gentle sheep named Maria. Maria had the softest wool in the flock. She loved to keep others warm. One winter, she noticed the children of the village shivering in the cold. She whispered, “I must find a way to help.”

Maria began to gather her wool carefully. She brushed it, cleaned it, and wove it into a blanket. She worked at night under the stars so no one would see. When the blanket was finished, she placed it quietly at the door of the school. The children found it the next morning. They wrapped themselves in its warmth and smiled. “Who gave us this gift?” they asked.

The teacher, Mr. Anton, said, “It must be a friend who cares.” Maria watched from the hill, her heart full of joy. She realized that kindness does not need recognition. It only needs love.

From that day, Maria made more blankets in secret. The villagers never knew who gave them, but they felt safe and warm. Maria’s gentle gift became a symbol of care. She learned that true kindness is quiet but powerful.---The End
