🌲 The Forest of Peaceful Steps!

In a European valley stretched a forest with soft paths. The villagers called it the Forest of Peaceful Steps. Children loved to walk there because the ground felt gentle.

One afternoon, Clara and Lukas led their friends along the path. They walked slowly, listening to birds and watching butterflies. Clara said, “Peace grows when we move kindly.”

The teacher explained, “Peaceful steps are not only in forests. They are in our hearts when we care for others.”

The children decided to mark the path with small stones. Each stone carried a word: kindness, courage, honesty. Villagers followed the path and felt calm.

From that day, the Forest of Peaceful Steps became a place where children learned that peace begins with gentle actions.---The End
